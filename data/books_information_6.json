We're in the most extreme and utter region of the human mind. A dim, subconscious underworld. A radiant abyss where men meet themselves. Hell, Netley. We're in Hell.\" Having proved himself peerless in the arena of reinterpreting superheroes, Alan Moore turned his ever-incisive eye to the squalid, enigmatic world of Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders of 1888. Weighing in at 576 pages, From Hell is certainly the most epic of Moore's works and remarkably and is possibly his finest effort yet in a career punctuated by such glorious highlights as Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Going beyond the myriad existing theories, which range from the sublime to the ridiculous, Moore presents an ingenious take on the slaughter. His Ripper's brutal activities are the epicentre of a conspiracy involving the very heart of the British Establishment, including the Freemasons and The Royal Family. A popular claim, which is transformed through Moore's exquisite and thoroughly gripping vision, of the Ripper crimes being the womb from which the 20th century, so enmeshed in the celebrity culture of violence, received its shocking, visceral birth. Bolstered by meticulous research that encompasses a wide spectrum of Ripper studies and myths and coupled with his ability to evoke sympathies in such monstrous characters, Moore has created perhaps the finest examination of the Ripper legacy, observing far beyond society's obsessive need to expose Evil's visage. Ultimately, as Moore observes, Jack's identity and his actions are inconsequential to the manner in which society embraced the Fear: \"It's about us. It's about our minds and how they dance. Jack mirrors our hysterias. Faceless, he is the receptacle for each new social panic.\" Eddie Campbell's stunning black and white artwork, replete with a scratchy, dirty sheen, is perfectly matched to the often-unshakeable intensity of Moore's writing. Between them, each murder is rendered in horrifying detail, providing the book's most unnerving scenes, made more so in uncomfortable, yet lyrical moments as when the villain embraces an eviscerated corpse, craving understanding; pleading that they \"are wed in legend, inextricable within eternity\". Though technically a comic, the term hardly begins to describe From Hell's inimitable grandeur and finesse, as it takes the medium to fresh heights of ingenuity and craftsmanship. Moore and Campbell's autopsy on the emaciated corpse of the Ripper myth has divulged a deeply disturbing yet undeniably captivating masterpiece. \u2014Danny Graydon\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Graphic Novels Comics", "Graphic Novels", "Crime", "Historical", "Comics", "Historical Fiction", "Horror", "Sequential Art", "Mystery", "Comic Book"]}, "26156469": {"bookid": "26156469", "title": "Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It", "author": "Chris Voss", "series": "", "ratings": "103138", "reviews": "6922", "rating": "4.37", "description": "A former FBI hostage negotiator offers a new, field-tested approach to negotiating \u2013 effective in any situation.After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri, Chris Voss joined the FBI, where his career as a kidnapping negotiator brought him face-to-face with bank robbers, gang leaders and terrorists.

Before Hitler was finally defeated, he had murdered six million Jews and nearly as many other Europeans. At war\u2019s end, both the German and the Soviet killing sites fell behind the iron curtain, leaving the history of mass killing in darkness.Bloodlands is a new kind of European history, presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single history, in the time and place where they occurred: between Germany and Russia, when Hitler and Stalin both held power. Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, Bloodlands will be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history.From BooklistIf there is an explanation for the political killing perpetrated in eastern Europe in the 1930s and 1940s, historian Snyder roots it in agriculture. Stalin wanted to collectivize farmers; Hitler wanted to eliminate them so Germans could colonize the land. The dictators wielded frightening power to advance such fantasies toward reality, and the despots toted up about 14 million corpses between them, so stupefying a figure that Snyder sets himself three goals here: to break down the number into the various actions of murder that comprise it, from liquidation of the kulaks to the final solution; to restore humanity to the victims via surviving testimony to their fates; and to deny Hitler and Stalin any historical justification for their policies, which at the time had legions of supporters and have some even today. Such scope may render Snyder\u2019s project too imposing to casual readers, but it would engage those exposed to the period\u2019s chronology and major interpretive issues, such as the extent to which the Nazi and Soviet systems may be compared.

This Harriman House edition includes Charles Mackay's account of the three infamous financial manias - John Law's Mississipi Scheme, the South Sea Bubble, and Tulipomania.Between the three of them, these historic episodes confirm that greed and fear have always been the driving forces of financial markets, and, furthermore, that being sensible and clever is no defence against the mesmeric allure of a popular craze with the wind behind it.In writing the history of the great financial manias, Charles Mackay proved himself a master chronicler of social as well as financial history. Blessed with a cast of characters that covered all the vices, gifted a passage of events which was inevitably heading for disaster, and with the benefit of hindsight, he produced a record that is at once a riveting thriller and absorbing historical document. A century and a half later, it is as vibrant and lurid as the day it was written.For modern-day investors, still reeling from the dotcom crash, the moral of the popular manias scarcely needs spelling out.

One stayed at home to raise her children and manage the family apple orchard; the other followed a dream and traveled the world to become a famous photojournalist. But when their beloved father falls ill, Meredith and Nina find themselves together again, standing alongside their cold, disapproving mother, Anya, who even now, offers no comfort to her daughters. As children, the only connection between them was the Russian fairy tale Anya sometimes told the girls at night. On his deathbed, their father extracts a promise from the women in his life: the fairy tale will be told one last time\u2014and all the way to the end.

This is the life of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, the heaviest drinking, hardest fighting, most oversexed and arrogant band in the world. Their unbelievable exploits are the stuff of rock 'n' roll legend. They nailed the hottest chicks, started the bloodiest fights, partied with the biggest drug dealers, and got to know the inside of every jail cell from California to Japan. They have dedicated an entire career to living life to its extreme, from the greatest fantasies to the darkest tragedies. Tommy married two international sex symbols; Vince killed a man and lost a daughter to cancer; Nikki overdosed, rose from the dead, and then OD'd again the next day; and Mick shot a woman and tried to hang his own brother. But that's just the beginning. Fueled by every drug they could get their hands on and obscene amounts of alcohol, driven by fury and headed straight for hell, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce raged through two decades, leaving behind a trail of debauched women, trashed hotel rooms, crashed cars, psychotic managers, and broken bones that has left the music industry cringing to this day. All these unspeakable acts, not to mention their dire consequences, are laid bare in The Dirt.Here -- directly from Nikki, Vince, Tommy, and Mick -- is the unexpurgated version of the whole glorious, gut-wrenching story. In these pages, published for the first time anywhere, are Tommy Lee's letters to Pamela Anderson from prison: Mick's confession to having an incurable disease that is slowly killing him; Vince's experience burying his own daughter -- and the train wreck that his life became afterward; and Nikki's anguished struggle to deal with an entire life fueled by anger over his childhood abandonment, his discovery of the family he never knew he had -- and his subsequent loss of them. And all of it accompanied by scores of rare, never-before-published photographs, mug shots, and handwritten lyrics. No one is spared. Not David Lee Roth, Ozzy Osbourne, Vanity, Aerosmith, Heather Locklear, AC/DC, Lita Ford, Iron Maiden, Pamela Anderson, Guns N' Roses, Donna D'Errico, RATT, or those two girls from Dallas, Texas.Make no mistake about it: these guys are geniuses. They invented glam metal and then left it in the dust; sold more than forty million albums from Shout at the Devil to Dr. Feelgood; toured the world dozen times and have the scars to prove it; and maintained a rabid following in an era of throwaway pop stars. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce has done nothing less than tattoo the psyche of the entire MTV generation. They are the ultimate rock 'n' roll band. And if you don't believe it, read The Dirt.

Many Americans are outraged by liberal hostility to traditional religion. But as Ann Coulter reveals in this, her most explosive book yet, to focus solely on the Left's attacks on our Judeo-Christian tradition is to miss a larger point: liberalism \"is\" a religion--a godless one. And it is now entrenched as the state religion of this county. Though liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, it bears all the attributes of a religion. In \"Godless,\" Coulter throws open the doors of the Church of Liberalism, showing us its sacraments (abortion), its holy writ (\"Roe v. Wade\"), its martyrs (from Soviet spy Alger Hiss to cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal), its clergy (public school teachers), its churches (government schools, where prayer is prohibited but condoms are free), its doctrine of infallibility (as manifest in the \"absolute moral authority\" of spokesmen from Cindy Sheehan to Max Cleland), and its cosmology (in which mankind is an inconsequential accident). Then, of course, there's the liberal creation myth: Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. For liberals, evolution is the touchstone that separates the enlightened from the benighted. But Coulter neatly reverses the pretense that liberals are rationalists guided by the ideals of free inquiry and the scientific method. She exposes the essential truth about Darwinian evolution that liberals refuse to confront: \"it is bogus science.\" Writing with a keen appreciation for genuine science, Coulter reveals that the so-called gaps in the theory of evolution are all there is--Darwinism is nothing but a gap. After 150 years of dedicated searching into the fossil record, evolution's proponents have failed utterly to substantiate its claims. And a long line of supposed evidence, from the infamous Piltdown Man to the \"evolving\" peppered moths of England, has been exposed as hoaxes. Still, liberals treat those who question evolution as religious heretics and prohibit students from hearing about real science when it contradicts Darwinism. And these are the people who say they want to keep faith out of the classroom? Liberals' absolute devotion to Darwinism, Coulter shows, has nothing to do with evolution's scientific validity and everything to do with its refusal to admit the possibility of God as a guiding force. They will brook no challenges to the official religion. Fearlessly confronting the high priests of the Church of Liberalism and ringing with Coulter's razor-sharp wit, \"Godless\" is the most important and riveting book yet from one of today's most lively and impassioned conservative voices. \"Liberals love to boast that they are not 'religious, ' which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion. Of course liberalism is a religion. It has its own cosmology, its own miracles, its own beliefs in the supernatural, its own churches, its own high priests, its own saints, its own total worldview, and its own explanation of the existence of the universe. In other words, liberalism contains all the attributes of what is generally known as 'religion.'\" --From Godless\n", "genres": ["Audiobook", "Womens", "Biology", "Nonfiction", "Humor", "Cultural", "Religion", "Political Science", "Evolution", "History", "Politics"]}, "91202": {"bookid": "91202", "title": "Chariots of The Gods", "author": "Erich von D\u00e4niken", "series": "", "ratings": "15143", "reviews": "1347", "rating": "3.53", "description": "Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods is a work of monumental importance--the first book to introduce the shocking theory that ancient Earth had been visited by aliens.

The world's largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii.But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta's sixty-mile main line\u2014somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius.Attilius\u2014decent, practical, and incorruptible\u2014promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies.

Discovering deception within deception, treachery within treachery, she was forced into a separate peace with her chief opponent, Lord Aral Vorkosigan - he who was called \"The Butcher of Komarr\" - and would consequently become an outcast on her own planet and the Lady Vorkosigan on his. Sick of combat and betrayal, she was ready to settle down to a quiet life, interrupted only by the occasional ceremonial appearances required of the Lady Vorkosigan. But when the Emperor died, Aral suddenly became guardian of the infant heir to the imperial throne of Barrayar - and the target of high-tech assassins in a dynastic civil war that was reminiscent of earth's Middle Ages, but fought with up-to-the minute biowar technology. Neither Aral nor Cordelia guessed the part that their cell-damaged unborn son would play in Barrayar's bloody legacy.

Everything you've seen or read till now took you only to the brink . . .  Neither pure fantasy, nor straight science fiction, nor earthbound dynastic saga, Dream Dancer is a stunning amalgam of all three. It is a family saga with the epic appeal of Dune and the action and excitement of Star Wars. It is a saga of love, power and treachery that will appeal to men and women equally; full of action, compulsively readable and quite unlike anything being published in the realms of fantasy today.  The heroine, Shebat, is a remarkable girl from Earth. She is brought to the vast empire of the Kerrion family by a renegade son; named as its future ruler on a whim of his autocratic father; abducted to the slums where the Kerrions' slaves drug themselves with powerful mystical sorcery; and finally rescued to take part in a great rebellion. She falls in love with one brother but marries another and becomes more Kerrion than some born to the name. A magical seductress of men, passionate in her lust for power, Shebat moves among those who control the destinies of millions, for whom treachery and betrayal are as easy as murder.  Set in the timeless future on a primitive, savage Earth and on the sophisticated habitats of deep space, Dream Dancer is the first volume of a three-part saga. . \"Not since Dune have we witnessed a power struggle of such awesome intensity.

The first of his three autobiographies, 1845's Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (also available from Cosimo), was written mainly to explain how he accomplished this astonishing feat. This, the second of his life stories, was published in 1855, and offers a more in-depth and-though seemingly impossible-even more thoughtful exploration of his life as a slave and his journey to escape it than his first book had. Douglass also discusses the challenges of life not only as a free man but as a famous one much in demand, as a public speaker in the Northern States and in Great Britain as well. This edition also includes the original publication's appendix, which features letters and speeches by the great man. A foundational work of African-American literature and a vital document of 19th-century American history, this is the extraordinary tale of a personal battle for freedom that became a fight for the very soul of a nation.\n", "genres": ["African American", "North American Hi...", "Biography", "Classics", "American History", "Nonfiction", "Race", "Cultural", "Biography Memoir", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "History"]}, "114128": {"bookid": "114128", "title": "Hidden Riches", "author": "Nora Roberts", "series": "", "ratings": "18413", "reviews": "467", "rating": "4.03", "description": "#1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts unveils the intriguing world of antiques dealing, where an independent woman discovers the price of breathless desire-and the schemes of an obsessed killer...Dora Conroy has a passion for antiques\u2014and any other rarities she can acquire for her quaint Philadelphia shop.

Most importantly however, he writes of the last 10 years, during which -- with the unswerving support of his wife, family, and friends -- he has dealt with his illness. He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure, and spread public awareness of the disease.

The Muppets made Jim Henson a household name, but they were only part of his remarkable story.This extraordinary biography--written with the generous cooperation of the Henson family--covers the full arc of Henson's all-too-brief life: from his childhood in Leland, Mississippi, through the years of burgeoning fame in Washington D.C., New York, and London, to the decade of international celebrity that preceded his untimely death at age fifty-three. Drawing on hundreds of hours of new interviews with Jim Henson's family, friends, and closest collaborators, as well as unprecedented access to private family and company archives--including never-before-seen interviews, business documents, and Henson's private letters--Brian Jay Jones explores the creation of the Muppets, Henson's contributions to Sesame Street and Saturday Night Live, and his nearly ten year campaign to bring The Muppet Show to television. Jones provides the imaginative context for Henson's non-Muppet projects, including the richly imagined worlds of The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth-as well as fascinating misfires like Henson's dream of opening an inflatable psychedelic nightclub or of staging an elaborate, all-puppet Broadway show.An uncommonly intimate portrait, Jim Henson captures all the facets of this American original: the master craftsman who revolutionized the presentation of puppets on television, the savvy businessman whose deal making prowess won him a reputation as \"the new Walt Disney,\" and the creative team leader whose collaborative ethos earned him the undying loyalty of everyone who worked for him. Here also is insight into Henson's intensely private personal life: his Christian Science upbringing; his love of fast cars, high-stakes gambling, and expensive art; and his weakness for women. Though an optimist by nature, Henson was haunted by the notion that he would not have time to do all the things he wanted to do in life-a fear that his heartbreaking final hours would prove all too well-founded.An up-close look at the charmed life of a legend, Jim Henson gives the full measure to a man whose joyful genius transcended age, language, geography, and culture-and continues to beguile audiences worldwide.\n", "genres": ["Media Tie In", "Audiobook", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "Culture", "Biography Memoir", "Tv", "Adult", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "History", "Art", "Pop Culture"]}, "34275222": {"bookid": "34275222", "title": "Force of Nature", "author": "Jane Harper", "series": "(Aaron Falk #2)", "ratings": "85942", "reviews": "8362", "rating": "3.84", "description": "Five women reluctantly pick up their backpacks and start walking along a muddy track.Only four come out on the other side.

Should it be Richard Franklin, the handsome, sophisticated engineer who treats her like a queen? Or Mike Harris, the down-to-earth nice guy who was her husband's best friend? Choosing one of them should bring her more happiness than she's had in years. Instead, Julie is soon fighting for her life in a nightmare spawned by a chilling deception and jealousy so poisonous that it has become a murderous desire\n", "genres": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Contemporary", "Drama", "Contemporary Romance", "Chick Lit", "Adult Fiction", "Adult", "Womens Fiction", "Thriller", "Mystery"]}, "16532": {"bookid": "16532", "title": "Of Love and Shadows", "author": "Isabel Allende", "series": "", "ratings": "28387", "reviews": "1184", "rating": "3.99", "description": "Beautiful and headstrong, Irene Beltr\u00e1n works as a magazine journalist\u2014a profession that belies her privileged upbringing and her engagement to an army captain.

It was a time of innocence and hope for a country with a new, young president. But for thirteen-year-old Frank Drum it was a grim summer in which death visited frequently and assumed many forms. Accident. Nature. Suicide. Murder.

They believe we carefully arrange each for cause and consequence to give life order and structure. Life, however, provides an alternative outlook, where it lays its elements according to its own will. The pavement is not carefully arranged; rather the elements lay loosely, and in between them are the white spaces that we fill with joy, sorrow, and the depth of what it means to be human. For Thibaut and Pierre-Auguste Desmarais, Lucy Nightingberg's return visit for a night in Amaury Babin's pub La Place de St-Paul will bring their individual paths into sharp relief. Over the course of one evening, memories, sudden recollections, and immediate emotions give rise to passion, longing, and the unveiling of beclouded secrets, as a delicate dance of fervent love and redemption roils. Unannounced glimpses into their pasts glue pieces of the story together, and an understanding of the narrative in its entirety is constructed from which a truth might be gleaned. A rich emotional tableau is the setting for an evening of love, passion, atonement in C. JoyBell C.'s new novella. Full of extraordinary depth and a keen sense for the primal needs of her disparate characters, her profound understanding of the human condition is reminiscent of the classics Madame Bovary and Wuthering Heights. As past and present collide, the author's focus on the universal and her fierce characterizations make this modern update of classic romanticism succeed where many fail, utilizing the underlying human experience to serve as a foundation to take a classic literary style and make it new. Though it is no small feat capturing the aesthetic of modern drama while simultaneously retaining the depth of a previous literary form, Saint Paul Trois Chateaux: 1948 accomplishes this task with ease and aplomb, consistently delivering startling moments of emotion the likes of which are rare indeed.\n", "genres": []}, "7057397": {"bookid": "7057397", "title": "By Fire, By Water", "author": "Mitchell James Kaplan", "series": "", "ratings": "1113", "reviews": "194", "rating": "3.73", "description": "Luis de Sant\u00e1ngel, chancellor to the court and longtime friend of the lusty King Ferdinand, has had enough of the Spanish Inquisition.

I didn\u2019t win the fortune I\u2019d dreamed of and plotted for, but I did unexpectedly fall in love with the sweetest, most beautiful woman I had ever seen in my life. When her pimp insulted me everything began to spiral out of control. I met her at the blackjack table. At the time I could not have known, no matter how clairvoyant I sometimes believed myself to be, just how auspicious this meeting had been, how it would set in motion a course of events that would ruin my life, other lives, change drug laws and overturn the results of a U.S. presidential election. Now, as I look back, I swear I felt a distinct chill slither down my spine as she whispered in her pimp\u2019s ear and walked off. Maybe I did, on some level, understand how ominous a moment it was; maybe there was a feeling of permanence about it, foretelling many hopeless years of cold and somber misery, foretelling an eternity of dreary solitude. Maybe, but I did not understand this at the time. If there was any way I could have known what I would soon have to endure, how much trouble I would encounter, how much abuse, how many accusations I would suffer and how many innocent lives I would impart suffering onto because of this meeting, I would have gotten up, left those inveterate drunkards and gone home at that very moment. But, of course, I did not know how to interpret that chill. I am not the type of man to easily accept an occasional misreading of instinct, but this is what happened. This is exactly the way it happened.Who could blame me for falling in love? Who could blame me for stealing a few measly dollars? For trying to help? Who could blame me for the deaths of all those people? It is not me, but a confluence of events that is to blame. Read this book and understand the plight of the genius, the misanthrope, the beguiled. Understand why I now walk the earth with downcast eyes, alone, a stranger, for the ruin of souls.

The kingdom itself has gone under attack as Jacan, a traitor to the crown, forces his armies through the magical borders. Looking back Preston should have recognized that it was all real.

It is 1975, a perfect spring in Istanbul. Kemal, scion of one of the city\u2019s wealthiest families, is about to become engaged to Sibel, daughter of another prominent family, when he encounters F\u00fcsun, a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation. Once the long-lost cousins violate the code of virginity, a rift begins to open between Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeosie\u2014a world, as he lovingly describes it, with opulent parties and clubs, society gossip, restaurant rituals, picnics, and mansions on the Bosphorus, infused with the melancholy of decay\u2014until finally he breaks off his engagement to Sibel. But his resolve comes too late. For eight years Kemal will find excuses to visit another Istanbul, that of the impoverished backstreets where F\u00fcsun, her heart now hardened, lives with her parents, and where Kemal discovers the consolations of middle-class life at a dinner table in front of the television. His obsessive love will also take him to the demimonde of Istanbul film circles (where he promises to make F\u00fcsun a star), a scene of seedy bars, run-down cheap hotels, and small men with big dreams doomed to bitter failure. In his feckless pursuit, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress and his afflicted heart\u2019s reactions: anger and impatience, remorse and humiliation, deluded hopes of recovery, and daydreams that transform Istanbul into a cityscape of signs and specters of his beloved, from whom now he can extract only meaningful glances and stolen kisses in cars, movie houses, and shadowy corners of parks. A last change to realize his dream will come to an awful end before Kemal discovers that all he finally can possess, certainly and eternally, is the museum he has created of his collection, this map of a society\u2019s manners and mores, and of one man\u2019s broken heart.A stirring exploration of the nature of romantic attachment and of the mysterious allure of collecting, The Museum of Innocence also plumbs the depths of an Istanbul half Western and half traditional\u2014its emergent modernity, its vast cultural history.

This fast paced, biographical work contains layers of storyline with twists and turns that are poignant, and startling.Join three young men\u2019s true stories as they launch themselves onto the college football scene and refuse to be denied their impact both on and off the field. These mistakenly overlooked college football players take over a struggling football team with their drive and motivation, all in an effort to rise to the challenge of one more football season. Living on the edge of college life as driven athletes, they face a dramatic conspiracy as they struggle in the face of athletic romance, real world politics of organizational behavior and creating their own futures as they are forced to lead the world around them much sooner than they ever expected.Heavy is the head that wears the crown as these extraordinary athletes have decisions to make that are crowded by circumstances that continually provide opportunities for them to fail in rising to the level of achievement that they know they have earned. Understanding their romantic interests and hearing their sex stories as they struggle not to be dragged under provides a highly insightful gaze into their world.The dynamics of college football, deciding on a future and motivation for achievement are illustrated here in a true story of the thin line between being an exceptional football player and the ever expanding world of claims that all performers are equal despite the results that prove to differentiate those same performers. At a new school, on a new team, joining the college ranks, these young men face more reality than they anticipated as they hold their future in their own hands and are first hand participants in the real world evolution of organizational politicking, power struggles and the freedom to pursue the college endeavor as they see fit. This true story is worth picking up simply to have an accurate overview of the inner workings and value of university education, college football and organizational manipulation. It serves as both a remarkable story of college life and as an instruction manual to the pitfalls of the people surrounding exceptional individuals, in addition to the political motivations of higher education organizations. College football, coaching motivations and the nature of organizational leaders is clearly depicted here as your guide.

But young Julie proves that she is ready to forge her own spiritual path and arrive at her own destination.

And when attempting to describe his personality, they find themselves in need of words with greater nuance. \u201cNeurotic\u201d is typically used. \u201cSociopath\u201d and \u201cnarcissist\u201d are also common terms. The most popular descriptor, however, is \u201cpathological.\u201dGrak, on the other hand, sees his situation in a rather different light. He finds his behavior \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cselfless,\u201d or even \u201cbenevolent\u201d when his mood is just so. Most often, though, he simply attributes his nature to \u201cbeing human.\u201dBut of all the things Grak despises, his antipathy for olives takes precedence. In his efforts to be rid of this nuisance, he gets his first taste of power and ignites a series of events with troubling consequences. Unwilling to give up his newfound influence, he sets about honing his only true talent: manipulation. But as his grip tightens, Grak\u2019s naively selfish exterior crumbles to reveal a dark and malicious evil \u2026In his debut work, author Peter J Story brews a robust psychological satire infused with dry humor and a pinch of emotion. Set just prior to recorded history, Things Grak Hates chronicles the life of a bizarre nomad and his descent toward evil. Along the way, this unconventional and introspective allegory explores a variety of complex issues. Among them: power, politics, religion, redemption, the dissemination of ideas, and human nature itself.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Comedy", "Humor", "Fantasy", "Literary Fiction", "Politics"]}, "20256797": {"bookid": "20256797", "title": "Safe & Sound", "author": "T.S.

Why? Because we ignore a crucial element: nature\u2019s holistic blueprint. Since human brains and psyche are expressions of it, how can we truly help humanity reach its potential? How can we help individuals be happy? Our ancestors had an intuitive grasp of this model, expressing it though their mythologies. It led psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung to find in Taoism -an example of this model- \"principles so vast that they can be applied to the entire humanity.\" With the rise of a highly specialized modern science though, this encompassing vision vanished. However, as Ariane Page found, brain research results agree with this overarching model. We can assume science will therefore soon \u201cdiscover\u201d it. In her second Editor\u2019s Choice and IndieFab finalist book \"Love Them Back to LIFE\", Ariane Page invites us to journey through this holistic blueprint and witness how we allow or prevent it from unfolding harmoniously in our personal lives. She takes us on a discovery journey through this model expressed by the human brain as she focuses on love. Love is the tool used by this model, the LIFE (Law Inherent to the Five Elements), to lead us toward a conscious coherence between our physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual realities, a holism necessary to truly feel alive, happy, and loved.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Self Help"]}, "22441997": {"bookid": "22441997", "title": "Melody Jackson and the House on Lafayette Street", "author": "B.M.B.

But it\u2019s not just his patients Roland has to worry about. He\u2019s working under a management triumvirate led by the psychopathic Interim Chief Executive Morten Slaney, the militaristic Nursing Manager Fitzpatrick and the self-serving Doctor Caldwell, who are only concerned with preserving the reputation of the institution. Roland knows he\u2019s in trouble with the management and his fears are elevated when he meets Annie Buchanan, a former staff member who confronted the sinister Slaney and ended up as a patient on the ward. When Roland meets fellow student Sophie Smith, she challenges him to prove he\u2019s not just all talk and no action, and they team up to take on the management regime. But Roland falls in love with Sophie and this fuses the mix of the personal and political in the closed world of the surreal sanctuary. Roland\u2019s experiences are punctuated by an eclectic series of tragi-comic events. As he copes with the extremes of institutionalised mental illness, he vacillates between helplessness and anger to affect any meaningful change. The easy solution is to self-medicate with his colleagues the Pothead Pixies. Eventually, facing defeat in love and politics, Roland is left abandoned, betrayed and fighting for his life, with only the enigmatic patient Alan Starr to guide and save him from himself.\n", "genres": []}, "36383208": {"bookid": "36383208", "title": "Loving Ordinary Life: The Self-Help Book for People Who Are Tired of Self-Help Books", "author": "Anastasia Petrenko", "series": "", "ratings": "95", "reviews": "31", "rating": "4.03", "description": "Loving Ordinary Life is written for us: living, emotional people.We all want to live a happy life, but we can easily fall into a state of despondency.

Today, this series of events is known as the Arab Spring. In January 2011, these events spread to Egypt, where they sparked the Egyptian revolution. For 18 days, protests rocked Egypt. This is where the story begins. This story will follow the events of one man as told through the digital trails one leaves on using today's technology. His emails, tweets, and blog posts will all be used in order to follow his story both during the actual revolution and in the subsequent year. During this time, the president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, was forced to step down from his position. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), head of the military in Egypt, dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. SCAF took over the country for six months until elections could be held. Political parties were in chaos; no one knew who could replace Mubarak. The only large organized force was the Muslim Brotherhood, an international group that had existed in Egypt since 1928, and enjoyed relative freedom under Mubarak's rule. Technically, elections had occurred in Egypt for a long time at this point. But Mubarak had ruled for thirty years, due to corruption, coercion, and manipulation of the elections. During his rule, many Egyptians lived well below the poverty level. Corruption was prevalent in the government, which groups opposing Mubarak had already been pointing out well before the revolution. The elections following the revolution were regarded by many as the first true chance for democratic elections within Egypt. It was not only the new president that would be elected in the elections. There would be new parliament members and those who started the uprising Egypt felt like they had a chance to achieve the change they dreamed of from the Parliament. If you\u2019ve read the news about Egypt since the revolution, you know that this is not what happened. Surprisingly, the vast majority of people did not support radical change to a new democracy, and opted instead to support the familiar traditional powers: the old regime and the Muslim Brotherhood. After a brief time in rule, the Muslim Brotherhood's man in presidency was ousted following popular protests, and the head of military was appointed as a president. In many ways, Egypt is back to where it was before.The stories from the revolution are therefore important in that they shed light on the actual events during that critical year that lead to the disappointing outcomes. The book goes beyond the mere narration of events and tries to find the causes of why things went as they did. The causes date back much older than one might imagine.In this story, we look back in time at the struggle for freedom through the eyes of one unnamed man. As you follow his story, keep in mind the events that have happened since, and keep in mind what is yet to come. ---Foreword by Jill Waller.Cover art by Smo Sienkiewicz.\n", "genres": ["Northern Africa", "Egypt"]}, "43528118": {"bookid": "43528118", "title": "The Explorer's Mindset: Unlock Health Happiness and Success the Fun Way", "author": "Francis Shenstone", "series": "", "ratings": "29", "reviews": "11", "rating": "4.59", "description": "Want to change your mindset, but don\u2019t know how?

His mother had uprooted her family from their small hometown of Akersburg, Georgia, a few years earlier, leaving behind Huey\u2019s white father and the racial unrest that ran deeper than the Chattahoochee River.

At Claremont, where the only other nonwhite person is the janitor, Huey quickly realizes that racism can lurk beneath even the nicest school uniform.

At the end of her first day of freedom, she was running from two men with a rope. Blazing through the forest, she felt the papers in her shoes she had spent years scribbling her hopes and dreams on. Since the age of eight, she had written down her dreams, trusting the words would rewrite her future. Every day after school she sprinted-shoes full of hope-to the local oil refinery, gawking through fence fabric at the flickering lights, as though they were beacons of promise. Her father was distrustful of other men, so public life was limited for Tracie. The windows inside the home were tacked with trash bags to block out any view of her mother. Violence permeated inside the home. Accusations were made daily. When Tracie was old enough, she grabbed a bag and left. That night two men watched her make camp in a forest and tried to capture her, but she escaped. The two men chasing her frightened her so much, she scrambled into a school the next morning for help. Tracie was placed in foster care with a loving family. The words in her shoes were coming to life. As an adult, she questioned her father's violent nature, so she sent off a tube of bubbling saliva to a DNA test site, hoping for answers. She was connected to dozens of relatives she never knew existed, grilling them for answers. She ended up going down a hole as deep and winding as a rabbit's warren. She discovered many twists, including the murder of her great-grandfather. Violence was handed down to each generation of males like an Olympic torch. Refined is a testament to the strength of young women, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising twist of DNA patterns handed down systematically from generation to generation. With words that are rich with life, Breaux has crafted a story that reminds us that we are forever shaped by our ancestors, and each of us has the power to refine our future into something beautiful.\n", "genres": ["Autobiography", "Memoir", "Nonfiction"]}, "57121698": {"bookid": "57121698", "title": "Pretty Dead Queens", "author": "Alexa Donne", "series": "", "ratings": "36", "reviews": "29", "rating": "4.64", "description": "Seaview High's homecoming queen is dead . . . and she's not the first.

Por\u00e9m, o sentimento de culpa assalta-o, principalmente quando come\u00e7a a ter vis\u00f5es sobre o falecido mandarim e sobre sua fam\u00edlia que agora passa dificuldades.Um ser misterioso, que \u00e9 obviamente o Diabo, prop\u00f5e a Teodoro um dilema terr\u00edvel: tocar uma campainha m\u00e1gica e matar, \u00e0 dist\u00e2ncia e de imediato, o riqu\u00edssimo Mandarim Ti Chin-Fu, que vivia nos confins da China. Este simples gesto faria dele o herdeiro e senhor de uma imensa fortuna! Teodoro cede \u00e0 tenta\u00e7\u00e3o e torna-se um nababo. Mas o crime, mesmo executado telepaticamente, n\u00e3o compensa...Publicada no Di\u00e1rio de Portugal em 1880, esta hist\u00f3ria foi nesse mesmo ano editada em livro. Conta a viagem de Teodoro at\u00e9 ao Oriente. De uma simples vida, este funcion\u00e1rio p\u00fablico passou a ambicionar tornar-se milion\u00e1rio e para que isso acontecesse ouviu o diabo.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Portuguese Literature", "Romance", "European Literature", "Literature", "Classics", "Short Stories", "Cultural", "Fantasy", "19th Century", "Portugal", "Novels"]}, "4784218": {"bookid": "4784218", "title": "Economics in One Lesson", "author": "Henry Hazlitt", "series": "", "ratings": "17598", "reviews": "1517", "rating": "4.17", "description": "Here is a publishing event: the new Mises Institute edition of the classic book that has taught many millions sound economic thinking.

It is a hardbound volume, priced very low thanks to special benefactors, and now available in quantity discounts for distribution to your friends, family, and anyone you meet who needs to understand what economics implies for the society, government, and civilization.Henry Hazlitt wrote this book following his stint at the New York Times as an editorialist. His hope was to reduce the whole teaching of economics to a few principles and explain them in ways that people would never forget. It worked. He relied on some stories by Bastiat and his own impeccable capacity for logical thinking and crystal-clear prose.He was writing under the influence of Mises himself, of course, but he brought his own special gifts to the project. As just one example, this is the book that made the idea of the \"broken window fallacy\" so famous.What thrills us in particular about this new edition is that it is beautiful, it is hardcover, and it is newly typeset for modern readers. It has a full index. It includes a wonderful foreword by Walter Block. It's the right size, shape, and feel \u2013 perfect for making this book central to all educational efforts of the future.This is the book to send to reporters, politicians, pastors, political activists, teachers, or anyone else who needs to know.Professor Block explains that it was this book that turned him on to economics as a science. He believes that it is probably the most important economics book ever written in the sense that it offers the greatest hope to educating everyone about the meaning of the science.Written for the non-academic, it has served as the major antidote to fallacies in the popular press, and has appeared in dozens of languages and printings. It's still the quickest way to learn how to think like an economist. And this is why it has been used in the best classrooms more than sixty years.Many writers have since attempted to beat this book as an introduction, but have never succeeded. Hazlitt's book remains the best. Even if you own this book already, or have several past editions, you will want to have this book as your own as a wonderful testament to its place in the world of ideas.In putting this edition together, we chose to work from Hazlitt's own first edition because it contains the core of what is crucial here without later updates that only date the book. As with Mises and Human Action, the author's first instincts were the best ones.Contents:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Part One: The Lesson\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Part Two: The Lesson Applied\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Broken Window\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Blessings of Destruction\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Public Works Mean Taxes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Taxes Discourage Production\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Credit Diverts Production\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Curse of Machinery\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Spread-the-Work Schemes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Disbanding Troops and Bureaucrats\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Fetish of Full Employment\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Who's \"Protected\" by Tariffs?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Drive for Exports\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o \"Parity\" Prices\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Saving the X Industry\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o How the Price System Works\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o \"Stabilizing\" Commodities\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Government Price-Fixing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Minimum Wage Laws\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o Do Unions Really Raise Wages?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o \"Enough to Buy Back the Product\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Function of Profits\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Mirage of Inflation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Assault on Savings\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0o The Lesson Restated\n", "genres": ["Currency", "Audiobook", "Classics", "Nonfiction", "Finance", "Money", "Economics", "Philosophy", "Business", "History", "Politics"]}, "316805": {"bookid": "316805", "title": "The Robber Hotzenplotz", "author": "Otfried Preu\u00dfler", "series": "(Hotzenplotz #1)", "ratings": "4875", "reviews": "112", "rating": "4.21", "description": "Robber Hotzenplotz held poor grandma at gunpoint with his pepper pistol and stole her coffee mill.

To free themselves from the daily terrors of Soviet rule, Stefan and his friends fight imaginary battles in nearby woods to defend their land. The games they play are their only escape. 'Sliding on the Snow Stone' is the true story of Stefan's extraordinary journey across a landscape of hunger, fear and devastating loss. With Europe on the brink of World War Two, Stefan and his family pray they'll survive in their uncertain world. They long to be free. (In 1932-33, as part of their drive towards industrialisation, the Soviet Union demanded impossibly high requisitions of grain from rural areas in Ukraine. In a deliberate act of genocide, Ukrainian smallholdings were stripped of food, and the population began to perish, with some estimates as high as 10 million deaths, from starvation. In Ukraine, this atrocity became known as the Holodomor (death by hunger). The following years saw Soviet purges and terrors resulting in the elimination of academics and intellectuals, or of anyone who spoke out against Soviet rule. When World War Two arrived on Ukraine's doorstep, many people viewed the Nazis as liberators - a view that was quickly proved wrong. 'Sliding on the Snow Stone' is Stefan's personal account of a historical period drenched in the blood of a nation, and of his yearning for freedom.)\n", "genres": ["Biography", "Nonfiction", "War", "Historical", "Cultural", "Russia", "Ukraine", "World War II", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "History"]}, "119": {"bookid": "119", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Art of the Fellowship of the Ring", "author": "Gary Russell", "series": "(The Art of The Lord of the Rings #1)", "ratings": "101585", "reviews": "158", "rating": "4.61", "description": "With complete and unrestricted access to artwork created over a five-year period, this authoritative and insightful book illustrates the creative development of The Fellowship of the Ring.

He recalls how he developed some of his enduring characters manic man-child Ed Grimley, elderly Tin Pan Alley songmith Irving Cohen, slimy lawyer Nathan Thurm, and the blubbery and bizarrely insensitive Jiminy Glick. Here, too, are his movie and television appearances, from the classic \" Three Amigos!\" to his Emmy-nominated role in \"Damages,\" as well as his stage productions, including his Tony Award winning performance in \"Little Me.\" Throughout, such friends and luminaries as Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, John Candy, Gilda Radner, Lorne Michaels, Nora Ephron, Frank Sinatra, and others share the spotlight.This deeply private man brings us into the circle of his family life, from raising his children to the legendary parties he and his wife hosted in their Los Angeles home. He recounts the pain of losing a brother and both parents by the time he was twenty and of the devastating death of Nancy, his wife of thirty years, in 2010. Despite the hardships, Short s life has been full of laughter, and he remains perennially upbeat.

BOOK DESCRIPTION: A novel about overcoming our own weaknesses when it doesn't feel like there is anything left to live for, Ripples through Time tells the story of Calvin Greenwood. A family man in his eighties, Calvin is alone for the first time in over sixty years. His wife, Emily, recently passed away and he isn't taking her death well. He doesn't remember how to be alone, and he doesn't know if he can forgive himself for the mistakes he made.Edward, a long time family friend, comes to check on him during this time of need. Edward understands just how dangerous things are for Calvin, and he's hoping to talk him out of doing the unthinkable. He just hopes he isn't too late to help.Help, however, isn't the easiest thing to give, and it can be even more difficult to accept....Love, loss, and forgiveness weave inextricably into this tale of friendship and hope. Ripples Through Time is a contemporary novel set in Middle America about aging and euthanasia that examines the good and bad moments in life and shows us that it takes all of them to build a person; often it is our mistakes that define us, but we should always have hope.The novel begins with a quote by Anne Lamott: \"Not forgiving is like drinking rat poison and waiting for the rat to die.\" Sometimes we need to ask, and grant, for forgiveness before it is too late.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Family", "Amazon", "Business"]}, "27853361": {"bookid": "27853361", "title": "Double Trouble", "author": "D.M.

The result is a strange love story that explores how far we'd really go, given the opportunity... and whether men and women could truly live together, if they were completely honest about their desires. This erotic and violent novel, criticized as pornographic, is nonetheless supremely literary and won its author a Ph.D. in English.

Alice and Mattia, both \"primes,\" are misfits who seem destined to be alone. Haunted by childhood tragedies that mark their lives, they cannot reach out to anyone else. When Alice and Mattia meet as teenagers, they recognize in each other a kindred, damaged spirit. But the mathematically gifted Mattia accepts a research position that takes him thousands of miles away, and the two are forced to separate. Then a chance occurrence reunites them and forces a lifetime of concealed emotion to the surface. Like Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, this is a stunning meditation on loneliness, love, and the weight of childhood experience that is set to become a universal classic.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Romance", "European Literature", "Young Adult", "Literature", "Italian Literature", "Contemporary", "Drama", "Italy", "Cultural", "Novels", "Roman"]}, "15762164": {"bookid": "15762164", "title": "Wooded Windows", "author": "Strider Marcus Jones", "series": "", "ratings": "7", "reviews": "3", "rating": "4.86", "description": "Read 14/75 poems and reviews from this book free on wattpad http://www.wattpad.com/story/1031729-...The poems in this book reflect on my journey through life, love, the Arab Spring and Occupy Movement.

She is afraid to tell her parents that she is pregnant out of wedlock, so her doctor suggests that Helga check into Heinrich Himmler\u2019s home for the Lebensborn.This is a program, he explains, that has been instituted by the Nazi\u2019s to create perfect Aryan babies. Since Helga is of pure German blood and the child\u2019s father is an SS officer, she will be accepted, the doctor explains. Her child will have a good life because adoption is available only to the finest of Hitler\u2019s Elite. Not only this, the doctor says but during her pregnancy, Helga will have the finest food and medical care available. And, instead of a life of shame, she will be honored for her efforts in producing a perfect Aryan child for the new world that Hitler is in the process of creating. Then after the baby is born, the Lebensborn will take the child and assume all future responsibilities releasing Helga to live her life without the burden of a fatherless offspring. In her desperation, all of this sounded perfect to Helga, that was of course before she felt life stir within her womb.However, by the time this occurred it was already too late. She had already moved into Steinhoring, home for the Lebensorn, and there was no possibility of turning back. The papers were signed. She could not escape. Hitler owned her unborn child. On a cold day in January Helga\u2019s little girl came into the world. But instead of being sheltered by her mother\u2019s arms, she was torn away by the nurses at the home for the Lebensborn and thrust into a treacherous world where the very people sworn to protect her were not what they seemed. The little girl was growing, and she was amongst some of the cruelest people on earth and subjected daily to the ideology of the Third Reich.But when Hitler became convinced that he was indestructible and, went to war on two fronts dividing his army, Germany began to fall. The Nazi\u2019s became fearful as America entered the war joining Churchill against them in the west, while Stalin a formidable enemy with the brutal Russian winters on his side, ripped them apart in the east. And so, the tables turned on the Third Reich. The cruel Nazi\u2019s, who believed they could not be defeated were about to swallow their pride and surrender at the feet of the Allies. The superior race would prove to be inferior after all. Hitler\u2019s elite would run for cover, some would commit suicide; some would be tried in Nuremberg for crimes against humanity, while others would escape with their tails tucked between their legs and head for South America or other friendly ports.But God had other plans for Helga\u2019s tiny innocent child, who had been born on that January morning. The child\u2019s life was about to change in a very strange but significant way. Instead of becoming whom and what the Nazi\u2019s had hoped to create, this child would be befriended and nurtured by the most unexpected people.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Romance", "Germany", "Amazon", "Historical", "War", "Cultural", "World War II", "Business", "Historical Fiction", "Holocaust", "Christian Fiction"]}, "22545313": {"bookid": "22545313", "title": "Chasing Shadows", "author": "Ashley Townsend", "series": "(Rising Shadows #2)", "ratings": "51", "reviews": "24", "rating": "4.25", "description": "Would you choose to entwine your fate with a hero of the past, even if it meant altering the future?The murder of an ancient king spurs Sarah Matthews to travel back in time, putting her life in jeopardy as she races against the clock to solve a thousand-year-old mystery and pick up the pieces of her star-crossed romance.

BREAKING THE WHITE CODE OF SILENCE, A COLLECTION OF PERSONAL NARRATIVES, is a collection that asks just that. While the literature on whiteness has long been dominated by an academic point of view, editors Gabrielle David and Sean Frederick Forbes came to the realization that there was an unmet need for an anthology of personal narratives about race and culture from the perspective of white Americans. In this conception process, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE WHITE IN AMERICA? was born.The first of its kind, this collection of 82 personal narratives reflects a vibrant range of stories from white Americans who speak frankly and openly about race, not only as it applies to people of color, but as it applies to themselves. In answering the question, some may offer viewpoints one may not necessarily agree with, but nevertheless, it is clear that each contributor is committed to answering it as honestly as possible.With an introduction by racial justice educator and writer, Debby Irving, and an afterword by award-winning poet, author and scholar, Tara Betts, the purpose of WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE WHITE IN AMERICA? is to, as Irving points out in her introduction, break the code of silence so that we can engage in frank conversations about race. An invaluable starting point that includes a glossary and a bibliography of suggested reading, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE WHITE IN AMERICA? is highly recommended for students, teachers and anyone else interested in seeking a deeper and richer understanding of race in America.

Like George Washington and his own hero Julius Caesar, he was one of the greatest soldier-statesmen of all times. Andrew Roberts\u2019s Napoleon is the first one-volume biography to take advantage of the recent publication of Napoleon\u2019s thirty-three thousand letters, which radically transform our understanding of his character and motivation. At last we see him as he was: protean multitasker, decisive, surprisingly willing to forgive his enemies and his errant wife Josephine. Like Churchill, he understood the strategic importance of telling his own story, and his memoirs, dictated from exile on St. Helena, became the single bestselling book of the nineteenth century. An award-winning historian, Roberts traveled to fifty-three of Napoleon\u2019s sixty battle sites, discovered crucial new documents in archives, and even made the long trip by boat to St. Helena. He is as acute in his understanding of politics as he is of military history. Here at last is a biography worthy of its subject: magisterial, insightful, beautifully written, by one of our foremost historians.\n", "genres": ["Biography", "Nonfiction", "War", "Historical", "France", "Cultural", "Biography Memoir", "Military History", "European History", "Military", "History", "Politics"]}, "18667307": {"bookid": "18667307", "title": "Tokyo Ghoul, Tome 1", "author": "Sui Ishida", "series": "(\u6771\u4eac\u55b0\u7a2e / Tokyo Ghoul #1)", "ratings": "111305", "reviews": "2782", "rating": "4.42", "description": "\u00c0 Tokyo, s\u00e9vissent des goules, monstres cannibales se dissimulant parmi les humains pour mieux s\u2019en nourrir. \u00c9tudiant timide, Ken Kaneki est plus int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par la jolie fille qui partage ses go\u00fbts pour la lecture que par ces affaires sordides, jusqu\u2019au jour o\u00f9 il se fait attaquer par l\u2019une de ces fameuses cr\u00e9atures.

If you are not afraid to step into spiritual no-man's land and test your knowledge, then this book will offer you a game-changing perspective. By combining religion, philosophy and science, author Faiz King has created a comprehensive guide to the struggle of religion and science. What Makes The Human Mind So Special? Back To Metaphysics. By the end of this book you will be able to understand the debate and realize that higher-order religious processes (e.g. Metaphysics) are necessary to realize the full extent of the rational and abstract properties of our human mind. And that's exactly what sets us apart from the rest of the creatures that live on this planet. God's Plan - How To Understand Centuries Of Evolution. After over 20 years of meticulous research, Faiz King has created the definitive successor to Charles Darwin's \"The Origin Of Species\" that is not afraid to take on this science giant and prove that Metaphysics (and subsequently God) is behind the development of modern science as we know it.

To every sound. Every suspicion. Every scent and every moment. Then Reacher will trust the people he once trusted with his life\u2014and take this thing all the way to the end.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE ECONOMIST With the wisdom, humor, curiosity, and sharp insights that have brought millions of readers to his New York Times column and his previous bestsellers, David Brooks has consistently illuminated our daily lives in surprising and original ways. In The Social Animal, he explored the neuroscience of human connection and how we can flourish together. Now, in The Road to Character, he focuses on the deeper values that should inform our lives.Looking to some of the world\u2019s greatest thinkers and inspiring leaders, Brooks explores how, through internal struggle and a sense of their own limitations, they have built a strong inner character. Labor activist Frances Perkins understood the need to suppress parts of herself so that she could be an instrument in a larger cause. Dwight Eisenhower organized his life not around impulsive self-expression but considered self-restraint. Dorothy Day, a devout Catholic convert and champion of the poor, learned as a young woman the vocabulary of simplicity and surrender. Civil rights pioneers A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin learned reticence and the logic of self-discipline, the need to distrust oneself even while waging a noble crusade.Blending psychology, politics, spirituality, and confessional, The Road to Character provides an opportunity for us to rethink our priorities, and strive to build rich inner lives marked by humility and moral depth.\u201cJoy,\u201d David Brooks writes, \u201cis a byproduct experienced by people who are aiming for something else.

It's not inspirational, romantic or full of laughs. Depending upon your perspective and final take on the tale, it's not even entirely fiction.This book is not for everyone. 'Lost in Infinity' is a novel intended for a very specific audience\u2026 The author would have you believe this is a \"psychological roller coaster wrapped in the factual memoir of a chronic insomniac suffering from apeirophobia (the fear of infinity).\" He would go on to explain that the \"novel unfolds the history of his life as he tries to unlock repressed memories through a near schizophrenic relationship with his own splintered subconscious.\" This is a clever ruse to suck in his niche reader. This book is not for everyone.Influenced by Chuck Palahniuk, Kurt Vonnegut and Carlton Mellick III, the novel offers a unique look into the private confessions of a self-absorbed blogger on the precipice of a mental breakdown. The recurring theme of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu leads you through the work giving glimpses of a dark past while offering anecdotes that will eerily relate to most readers. Mixing in humor and satire with a confused childhood spent under the microscope of therapists keeps the mood light while he digs deeper into his past looking for the root of his problems. The narrator pulls back the curtain and reveals his dark inner turmoil as he fears a slow deliberate path toward schizophrenia. A repetition of events and recollections leads the reader through the twisted break the author fears while touching on life's everyday issues and questions. He delves into sleepless nights, stress, relationships and the pitfalls of higher education while he openly offers opinions on religion, suicide, insomnia, depression and the meaning of life.Many casual readers will be turned off by the jumping timeline. Some will be confused by the author's back and forth focus on his missing memories. The first person pseudo-oral narrative will leave others simply frustrated. The rest will grow sick of the author's defense mechanisms, most often hiding behind his pretentious recollections of growing up a childhood 'genius'. This book is not for everyone.Now that you've been properly warned and many have moved on to their next light read\u2026'Lost in Infinity' is part social commentary, part psychological mystery and part diary. What begins as an egotistical journal from an overconfident, yet anti-social, bratty blogger slowly dissolves into the twisted chaos of a mind on the brink of collapse. The reader is eventually forced to decide if the book is a cry for help from a man attempting to rationalize his schizophrenia or a clever ruse to make them stop and contemplate the meaning of existence. 'Lost in Infinity' will leave the reader questioning everything they thought they knew about the author's sanity, about their own life, about existence and the infinite universe beyond.\n", "genres": []}, "215686": {"bookid": "215686", "title": "Aur\u00e9lia and Other Writings", "author": "G\u00e9rard de Nerval", "series": "", "ratings": "885", "reviews": "46", "rating": "4.04", "description": "Aurelia is French poet and novelist Gerard de Nerval's account of his descent into madness--a condition provoked in part by his unrequited passion for an actress named Jenny Colon.

One of the original self-styled -bohemians, - Nerval was best known in his own day for parading a lobster on a pale blue ribbon through the gardens of the Palais-Royal, and was posthumously notorious for his suicide in 1855, hanging from an apron string he called the garter of the Queen of Sheba. This hallucinatory document of dreams, obsession, and insanity has fascinated artists such as Joseph Cornell, who cited passages from it to explain his own work; Antonin Artaud, who saw his own madness mirrored by Nerval's; and Andre Breton, who placed Nerval in the highest echelon of Surrealist heroes. Geoffrey Wagner's translation of Aurelia was first published by Grove Press in 1959, but has remained out of print for nearly 20 years. Also included in this volume are previously untranslated stories by Marc Lowenthal, and poet Robert Duncan's version of the sonnet cycle Chimeras, making this the most complete collection of Nerval's influential oeuvre ever published in English.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "European Literature", "Literature", "Classics", "Psychology", "Short Stories", "France", "Cultural", "French Literature", "19th Century", "Poetry", "Novels"]}, "13309364": {"bookid": "13309364", "title": "Desert Rose: The Life and Legacy of Coretta Scott King", "author": "Edythe Scott Bagley", "series": "", "ratings": "42", "reviews": "9", "rating": "4.24", "description": "Desert Rose details Coretta Scott King's upbringing in a family of proud, land-owning African Americans with a profound devotion to the ideals of social equality and the values of education, as well as her later role as her husband's most trusted confidant and advisor.\u00a0 Coretta Scott King\u2014noted author, human rights activist, and wife and partner of famed Civil Rights Movem\nDesert Rose details Coretta Scott King's upbringing in a family of proud, land-owning African Americans with a profound devotion to the ideals of social equality and the values of education, as well as her later role as her husband's most trusted confidant and advisor.\u00a0 Coretta Scott King\u2014noted author, human rights activist, and wife and partner of famed Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr.\u2014grew up in the rural Alabama Black Belt with her older sister, Edythe Scott Bagley. Bagley chronicles the sisters\u2019 early education together at the Crossroads School and later at the progressive Lincoln School in Marion. She describes Coretta\u2019s burgeoning talent for singing and her devotion to musical studies, and the sisters\u2019 experiences matriculating at Antioch College, an all-white college far from the rural South. Bagley provides vivid insights into Coretta\u2019s early passion for racial and economic justice, which lead to her involvement in the Peace Movement and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. As Coretta\u2019s older sister, Edythe shared in almost all of Coretta\u2019s many trials and tribulations. Desert Rose charts Coretta\u2019s hesitance about her romance with Martin Luther King and the prospect of having to sacrifice her dream of a career in music to become a minister\u2019s wife.\u00a0Ultimately, Coretta chose to utilize her artistic gifts and singing voice for the Movement through the development and performance of Freedom Concerts. This book also charts Coretta\u2019s own commitment and dedication, in the years that followed King\u2019s death, to the causes of international civil rights, the antiapartheid movement, and the establishment of the King Center in Atlanta and the national King Holiday. Coretta\u2019s devotion to activism, motherhood, and the movement led by her husband, and her courageous assumption of the legacy left in the wake of King\u2019s untimely assassination, are wonderfully detailed in this intimate biography.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography"]}, "6218281": {"bookid": "6218281", "title": "The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie", "author": "Alan Bradley", "series": "(Flavia de Luce  #1)", "ratings": "158278", "reviews": "17169", "rating": "3.82", "description": "It is the summer of 1950\u2013and at the once-grand mansion of Buckshaw, young Flavia de Luce, an aspiring chemist with a passion for poison, is intrigued by a series of inexplicable events: A dead bird is found on the doorstep, a postage stamp bizarrely pinned to its beak.

The tales draw on pre-Christian Celtic mythology, international folktale motifs and early medieval historical traditions. While some details may hark back to older Iron Age traditions, each of the tales is the product of a developed medieval Welsh narrative tradition, both oral and written.Lady Charlotte Guest in the mid 19th century was the first to publish English translations of the collection, popularising the name \"Mabinogion\". The stories appear in either or both of two medieval Welsh manuscripts, the White Book of Rhydderch or Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch, written c.1350, and the Red Book of Hergest or Llyfr Coch Hergest, written c.1382 \u2013 1410, tho texts or fragments of some of the tales have been preserved in earlier 13th century and later mss.Scholars agree that the tales are older than the existing mss, but disagree over just how much older. The different texts originated at different times. Debate has focused on the dating of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. Sir Ifor Williams offered a date prior to 1100, based on linguistic and historical arguments, while later Saunders Lewis set forth a number of arguments for a date between 1170 and 1190; Th Charles-Edwards, in a paper published in 1970, discussed both viewpoints, and while critical of the arguments of both scholars, noted that the language of the stories fits the 11th century. More recently, Patrick Sims-Williams argued for a plausible range of about 1060 to 1200, the current scholarly consensus.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Folklore", "Medieval", "Literature", "Classics", "Mythology", "Historical", "Short Stories", "Arthurian", "Fantasy", "Poetry"]}, "15762249": {"bookid": "15762249", "title": "Mavericks", "author": "Strider Marcus Jones", "series": "", "ratings": "11", "reviews": "5", "rating": "5.00", "description": "Read 10/52 poems and reviews from MAVERICKS free on wattpad http://www.wattpad.com/story/90631-10...Essentially, these poems are about Man and Woman and Love.

But, now we know that it is not money or bad luck or even Karma that is the cause of your fate - it's Anti-Matter. Truth is indeed stranger than Fiction. Anti-Matter is both a love story and a classic Science Fiction story that reveals exactly how our fate is created not by us as individuals, but by how we maneuver through the universe and all of the powerful forces that it creates just to mess with us. The story of the creator of the Anti-Matter Ray gun will astound and amaze you. When the Anti-Matter bomb hits the planet, everything goes topsy-turvy Up is Down. Left is Right and inside is out. We now know that Anti-Matter is made in thunderstorms here on Earth in quantities sufficient to change lives. It is also made inside Black Holes, stars that have become so massive that nothing can escape, not even light and this is why they are Black Holes. Ever since this amazing stuff was discovered floating around in the universe scientists have been struggling to find out what impact anti-matter might be having on our world. In this amazing new Science Fiction adventure, you not only find out how anti-matter works in our world, but also how it may be impacting your life right now at this very moment. When any particle of anti-matter comes into contact with the normal matter that we all take for granted, the air we breathe, our bodies, our cars, our houses, our clothing, etc. the two opposite types of matter annihilate one another instantly. If anti-matter hits your brain, your thinking is going to be severely altered. Your future may be changed as well, since your future is greatly dependent upon what you're thinking at any given time. Every aspect of our thinking, every aspect of our daily lives is powered by the atomic structure of matter. The atoms, as we know, like Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc. are the major components of molecules. Molecules are what we are composed of that moves our bodies, helps us breathe, digests our food, allows us to think. In any of these processes, especially when we fall in love, we don't want too much interference from anyone or anything, and we may be able to defend against alot of things. But we have no defenses against anti-matter. So, when we ourselves come into contact with anti-matter, parts of ourselves vanish, disappear, it is annihilated. How much of this anti-matter/matter annihilation is required before serious damage is done, no one knows. This is a story about a group of people who have more than enough anti-matter in their lives to change their lives drastically several times over. This is the story of the inventor of the anti-matter ray and what happened after his ray gun was introduced to the world. This is the story of the inventor of the Anti-Matter Ray and what happened after his ray gun was introduced to the world. The amazing twists and turns will amaze and entertain and cause great consternation in your life if you have ever encountered an event in your life that you could not explain. Now, you will be able to put it down to Anti-Matter. This story is not meant for the squeamish or the mentally challenged. This is a story that will literally annihilate your present conception of what reality means and it may even help you discover a better universe in which you are meant to live and breathe in. If you thought you knew just about everything regarding what happens in this universe - if you thought you knew just about everything that was going to happen to you in the next twenty-four hours - guess again. Anti-matter is out there, and there's more and more of it sneaking into our world every day. An anti-matter storm rages all around us every day and is causing the greatest chaos this world has ever known.

In August 2003, Jim Beaver, a character actor whom many know from the popular HBO series Deadwood, and his wife Cecily learned what they thought was the worst news possible- their daughter Maddie was autistic. Then six weeks later the roof fell in-Cecily was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer.  Jim immediately began writing a nightly e-mail as a way to keep more than one hundred family and friends up to date about Cecily's condition. Soon four thousand people a day, from all around the world, were receiving them. Initially a cathartic exercise for Jim, the prose turned into an unforgettable journey for his readers.  Cecily died four months after being diagnosed, but Jim continued the e-mails for a year after her diagnosis, revealing how he and Maddie coped with Cecily's death and how they managed to move forward. \"Life's That Way\" is a compilation of those nightly e-mails. Jim's experience is universal for anybody who has lost a loved one. But \"Life's That Way\" is not solely about loss. It is an immediate, day-by-day account of living through a nightmare but also of discovering the joy of a child, of being on the receiving end of unthinkable kindness, and of learning to navigate life anew. As Jim says, these are hard-won blessings.

Eminent Canadian law professor and legal theorist Joel Bakan contends that today's corporation is a pathological institution, a dangerous possessor of the great power it wields over people and societies.In this revolutionary assessment of the history, character, and globalization of the modern business corporation, Bakan backs his premise with the following observations:-The corporation\u2019s legally defined mandate is to pursue relentlessly and without exception its own economic self-interest, regardless of the harmful consequences it might cause to others. -The corporation\u2019s unbridled self-interest victimizes individuals, society, and, when it goes awry, even shareholders and can cause corporations to self-destruct, as recent Wall Street scandals reveal. -Governments have freed the corporation, despite its flawed character, from legal constraints through deregulation and granted it ever greater authority over society through privatization.But Bakan believes change is possible and he outlines a far-reaching program of achievable reforms through legal regulation and democratic control.Featuring in-depth interviews with such wide-ranging figures as Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman, business guru Peter Drucker, and cultural critic Noam Chomsky, The Corporation is an extraordinary work that will educate and enlighten students, CEOs, whistle-blowers, power brokers, pawns, pundits, and politicians alike.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Culture", "Society", "Psychology", "Law", "Finance", "Economics", "Business", "History", "Politics", "Sociology"]}, "13758478": {"bookid": "13758478", "title": "Spontaneous Combustion: Enlightenment and the Cosmic Crucible", "author": "Miles Gentry", "series": "", "ratings": "10", "reviews": "3", "rating": "4.20", "description": "Ancient Mysteries ~ Bible Prophecy ~ Esoteric Truths Revealed.Shattering the dogmatic interpretations long held by the \u201cchurches,\u201d the author has revisited many of the Bible\u2019s mysteries, and now presents the esoteric truths contained within.

It has emerged as a most lucid and engaging guide for those who yearn for a more robust and thoughtful public discourse. \"In terms we can all understand,\" wrote Jonathan Rauch in The New York Times, Justice \"confronts us with the concepts that lurk . . . beneath our conflicts.\"Affirmative action, same-sex marriage, physician-assisted suicide, abortion, national service, the moral limits of markets\u2015Sandel relates the big questions of political philosophy to the most vexing issues of the day, and shows how a surer grasp of philosophy can help us make sense of politics, morality, and our own convictions as well.Justice is lively, thought-provoking, and wise\u2015an essential new addition to the small shelf of books that speak convincingly to the hard questions of our civic life.\n", "genres": ["Social Justice", "School", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Culture", "Society", "Social Movements", "Academic", "Philosophy", "Law", "History", "Politics", "Sociology"]}, "187633": {"bookid": "187633", "title": "Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking", "author": "David Bayles", "series": "", "ratings": "80381", "reviews": "1190", "rating": "3.76", "description": "\"This is a book about making art.

Read on your PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet or Kindle device. Opiate addiction has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, and the problem shows no signs of slowing. Overcoming addiction is tough and, with opiates, many find it nearly impossible. Overdose deaths from prescription painkillers have more than quadrupled over the last fifteen years, and this is just a fraction of the problem. In fact, with prescription opiate addiction now shown to be a gateway drug to heroin, the issue is only getting worse. Last year alone, 11.5 million Americans abused some type of opioid, and more than 660,000 have used heroin in the past year.  If you or someone you love is addicted to opiates,  Opiate Addiction , now in its 6th Edition, offers a powerful message balanced with both useful information and hope for a way out from its stifling grip. There is no doubt that addiction is a cunning and cruel disease that robs its victims of nearly everything. Those suffering from opiate addiction are often baffled by its effects on their lives and the devastation that can be wrought in such a short period of time. Loved ones feel helpless and hopeless as they are forced to stand by and watch as someone they care about erodes before their eyes. Are you looking to move beyond addiction? With a clear approach to providing hard facts and drawing on her own history of opiate addiction and recovery, author Taite Adams is able to give the opiate addict or their loved ones answers to many questions, allay common fears, and provide a clear direction for a way out. Some of the areas that are addressed in detail are:  The Opiate Addiction Epidemic What are Opiates and How They Work Pain Pills and Painkiller Addiction Prescription Drug Abuse and Chronic Pain Heroin Addiction Opiate Maintenance Drugs and Substitution Therapy Opiate Addiction as a Disease A Way Out for the Opiate Addict Managing Opiate Detox Going to Treatment for Opiate Addiction and Much More Whether just coming to terms with the idea that there is a \"problem\", looking for opiate detox help, or considering going to treatment, opiate and heroin addiction help is available in many forms and Opiate Addiction  is an invaluable tool to get your questions answered about overcoming addiction and help you move one step closer to freedom and to a better way of life. 6th Edition Released January 10, 2018.

And most importantly, can we recognize tyranny when it is sold to us disguised as a form of liberty? Dr. Paul writes that to believe in liberty is not to believe in any particular social and economic outcome. It is to trust in the spontaneous order that emerges when the state does not intervene in human volition and human cooperation. It permits people to work out their problems for themselves, build lives for themselves, take risks and accept responsibility for the results, and make their own decisions. It is the seed of America.

In 1989, Anna Wang was one of a lucky few who worked for a Japanese company, Canon.

Her daily commute on Beijing\u2019s impossibly crowded buses brought into view the full spectrum of China\u2019s economic and social inequalities during the economic transition. When Tiananmen Protests broke out, her Japanese boss was concerned whether the protests would obstruct Canon\u2019s assembly plant in China, and she was sent to Tiananmen Square on a daily basis to take photos for her boss to analyze for evidence of turning tides. From the perspective as a member of the emerging middle class, she observed firsthand that Tiananmen Protests stemmed from Chinese people\u2019s longing for political freedom and their fear for the nascent market economy, an observation that readers have never come across from the various accounts of the historical events so far.\n", "genres": ["China", "Asia", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "Historical", "Cultural", "Biography Memoir", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "History", "Politics"]}, "24233708": {"bookid": "24233708", "title": "An Absolutely Remarkable Thing", "author": "Hank Green", "series": "(The Carls #1)", "ratings": "89276", "reviews": "14389", "rating": "4.03", "description": "The Carls just appeared.Roaming through New York City at three AM, twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture.

Using his political and criminal connections, Geran seeks to dispose of her before she can prove her innocence and expose his complicity. He enlists the aid of her twin sister, Beka, who is a captain in the Guardians, a branch of the Galactic Defense Forces responsible for pursuing criminals. Past animosity between the sisters ensures that there will be no cooperation between the two, and that Rena will find no allies in her sister's squad. However, she is not without resources of her own, and using unrevealed telekinetic talents, she is able to escape off world to Fenaira, a planet obsessed with protecting their environment no matter the cost in human lives.  As Beka and her squad attempt to track Rena down, they are forced to battle the dangerous wildlife and difficult terrain with the limited equipment and supplies allowed by the Fenairan officials. Rena's illusions and tricks slow them down even more, allowing her to increase the distance between them. Geran's other forces, including his chief-of-security assigned as liaison with Beka's squad, further hinder their efforts, threatening to not only prevent them from completing their mission, but also endangering their lives.  The Illusion of Murder is a science fiction story set in the midst of the corrupt democratic society of the Galactic Confederacy. Beka and Rena, forced onto opposite sides of the law, must put their past, with its tangle of old hurts and misconceptions, behind them as they face predator cats, dangerous betrayals, and a shadowy group that believes they know too much. Their very survival depends on them achieving a level of cooperation that neither of them desires, nor believes to be possible.\n", "genres": []}, "40700503": {"bookid": "40700503", "title": "Percy Jackson and the Greek Gods (English)", "author": "Rick Riordan", "series": "(Camp Half-Blood Chronicles)", "ratings": "66722", "reviews": "4325", "rating": "4.47", "description": "Who could tell the true stories of the gods and goddesses of Olympus better than modern-day demigod Percy Jackson?

His life has been filled with music, and having only songs for companions, he develops a voice that is unlike any heard before. Ansset's voice is both a blessing and a curse, for the young Songbird can reflect all the hopes and fears his auidence feels and, by magnifying their emotions, use his voice to heal--or to destroy. When it is discovered that his is the voice that the Emperor has waited decades for, Ansset is summoned to the Imperial Palace on Old Earth. Many fates rest in Ansset's hands, and his songs will soon be put to the test: either to salve the troubled conscience of a conqueror, or drive him, and the universe, into mad chaos.Songmaster is a haunting story of power and love--the tale of the man who would destroy everything he loves to preserve humanity's peace, and the boy who might just sing the world away.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Audiobook", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Music", "Fantasy", "LGBT", "Adult", "Speculative Fiction", "Novels"]}, "835623": {"bookid": "835623", "title": "How the Mind Works", "author": "Steven Pinker", "series": "", "ratings": "19366", "reviews": "638", "rating": "3.99", "description": "In this extraordinary bestseller, Steven Pinker, one of the world's leading cognitive scientists, does for the rest of the mind what he did for language in his 1994 book, The Language Instinct.

He explains what the mind is, how it evolved, and how it allows us to see, think, feel, laugh, interact, enjoy the arts, and ponder the mysteries of life. And he does it with the wit that prompted Mark Ridley to write in the New York Times Book Review, \"No other science writer makes me laugh so much. . . .

Pinker rehabilitates some unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection, and challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, and that nature is good and modern society corrupting.

Everyone of whatever age, outlook, education or station in life knows the essential part of the epic and adores the main figures in it - Rama and Sita. Every child is told the story at bedtime . . .

Although the Sanskrit original was composed by Valmiki, probably around the fourth century BC, poets have produced countless variant versions in different languages. Here, drawing his inspiration from the work of an eleventh-century Tamil poet called Kamban, Narayan has used the talents of a master novelist to recreate the excitement and joy he has found in the original. It can be enjoyed and appreciated, he suggests, for its psychological insight, its spiritual depth and its practical wisdom - or just as a thrilling tale of abduction, battle and courtship played out in a universe thronged with heroes, deities and demons.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Hinduism", "Epic", "Classics", "India", "Mythology", "Cultural", "Religion", "Spirituality", "Fantasy", "Poetry"]}, "13563459": {"bookid": "13563459", "title": "Asura: Tale Of The Vanquished", "author": "Anand Neelakantan", "series": "", "ratings": "12373", "reviews": "1379", "rating": "3.68", "description": "The epic tale of victory and defeat\u2026 The story of the Ramayana had been told innumerable times.

The enthralling story of Rama, the incarnation of God, who slew Ravana, the evil demon of darkness, is known to every Indian. And in the pages of history, as always, it is the version told by the victors that lives on. The voice of the vanquished remains lost in silence. But what if Ravana and his people had a different story to tell? The story of the Ravanayana has never been told. Asura is the epic tale of the vanquished Asura people, a story that has been cherished by the oppressed castes of India for 3000 years. Until now, no Asura has dared to tell the tale. But perhaps the time has come for the dead and the defeated to speak. \u201cFor thousands of years, I have been vilified and my death is celebrated year after year in every corner of India. Why? Was it because I challenged the Gods for the sake of my daughter? Was it because I freed a race from the yoke of caste-based Deva rule? You have heard the victor\u2019s tale, the Ramayana. Now hear the Ravanayana, for I am Ravana, the Asura, and my story is the tale of the vanquished.\u201d \u201cI am a non-entity \u2013 invisible, powerless and negligible. No epics will ever be written about me. I have suffered both Ravana and Rama \u2013 the hero and the villain or the villain and the hero. When the stories of great men are told, my voice maybe too feeble to be heard. Yet, spare me a moment and hear my story, for I am Bhadra, the Asura, and my life is the tale of the loser.\u201d The ancient Asura empire lay shattered into many warring petty kingdoms reeling under the heel of the Devas. In desperation, the Asuras look up to a young saviour \u2013 Ravana. Believing that a better world awaits them under Ravana, common men like Bhadra decide to follow the young leader. With a will of iron and a fiery ambition to succeed, Ravana leads his people from victory to victory and carves out a vast empire from the Devas. But even when Ravana succeeds spectacularly, the poor Asuras find that nothing much has changed from them. It is then that Ravana, by one action, changes the history of the world.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Indian Literature", "Literature", "India", "Mythology", "Historical", "Asian Literature", "Cultural", "Fantasy", "Historical Fiction", "Unfinished", "Novels"]}, "3335784": {"bookid": "3335784", "title": "Teatro de Gil Vicente", "author": "Gil Vicente", "series": "", "ratings": "93", "reviews": "4", "rating": "3.77", "description": "Cont\u00e9mAuto da \u00cdndiaAuto da Barca do InfernoAuto da Barca da Gl\u00f3riaFarsa de In\u00eas PereiraGil Vicente foi o fundador do teatro portugu\u00eas.

The always funny, frank, and down-to-earth medium\u2014whether she\u2019s talking to her family, the local butcher, or the souls of those who\u2019ve passed on\u2014began communicating with Spirit at the age of four, but didn\u2019t fully accept her gift until she was thirty-three years old. She had a good life as a busy wife and working mom, but also suffered from chronic anxiety that, as it turned out, came from ignoring her abilities. Once Theresa began channeling, she realized that she felt much better after delivering a message from Spirit and releasing that energy. Since then she\u2019 s used her extraordinary gift to help people heal from the loss of their loved ones.Theresa feels that it\u2019s her purpose to make us all aware that there is more to life than what we see here in the physical world. She wants you to know that your deceased loved ones are safe and at peace, and that they\u2019re now with you in a different way\u2014watching over you, loving you, and assisting you from the Other Side. She also wants you to realize that the unexplainable things you sense and feel from these souls are real, and that it\u2019s healthy and essential to acknowledge them.There\u2019s More to Life Than This lends insight on how Theresa\u2019s mediumship works, what happens to your soul when you die, what Spirit says Heaven is like, what the deceased want you to know, the importance of living a positive life, and the many roles that your family, friends, angels, guides, souls of faith, and God play here and in the afterlife. It also explores how to safely connect with Spirit, so that you can recognize when your loved ones are reaching out.Through Theresa\u2019s personal story, compelling anecdotes, and fascinating client readings, she teaches us about how she communicates with Spirit and helps us to understand and appreciate the important lessons and touching messages that we\u2019re meant to embrace every day.\n", "genres": ["Metaphysics", "Audiobook", "Biography", "New Age", "Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Paranormal", "Spirituality", "Fantasy", "Inspirational", "Philosophy", "Autobiography", "Memoir"]}, "13608643": {"bookid": "13608643", "title": "A Flicker of Light", "author": "Roberta Kagan", "series": "", "ratings": "1488", "reviews": "129", "rating": "3.91", "description": "In 1935, the Nazi's established a program called \u201cThe Lebensborn.\u201d Their agenda, to genetically engineer perfect Aryan children.These children were to be the new master race, once HItler had cleared all undesirable elements out of Europe.

From his 1935 debut with The Universal History of Iniquity, through his immensely influential collections Ficciones and The Aleph, these enigmatic, elaborate, imaginative inventions display Borges' talent for turning fiction on its head by playing with form and genre and toying with language. Together these incomparable works comprise the perfect one-volume compendium for all those who have long loved Borges, and a superb introduction to the master's work for those who have yet to discover this singular genius.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "European Literature", "Latin American", "Literature", "Classics", "Short Stories", "Magical Realism", "Cultural", "Fantasy", "Spanish Literature", "Literary Fiction", "Philosophy"]}, "34927828": {"bookid": "34927828", "title": "The Great Alone", "author": "Kristin Hannah", "series": "", "ratings": "529627", "reviews": "49173", "rating": "4.37", "description": "Alaska, 1974.Unpredictable.

The state of God-Realisation is symbolised through union with a Beloved, and drinking the wine of spiritual love.This compact version of the Divan of Hafez is a facsimile illuminated manuscript, complete with beautiful Persian calligraphy and miniature illustrations. There are 43 ghazals, translated into English by classical scholar Gertrude Bell. It is a truly beautiful introduction not only to the works of this beloved Sufi mystic, but also to the artistry of Mahmoud Farshchian. It is like getting two books in one: poetry and art.\"Hafiz has no peer.\" \u2014 GoethePoetry is the greatest literary form of ancient Persia and modern Iran, and the fourteenth-century poet known as Hafiz is its preeminent master. Little is known about the poet's life, and there are more legends than facts relating to the particulars of his existence. This mythic quality is entirely appropriate for the man known as \"The Interpreter of Mysteries\" and \"The Tongue of the Hidden,\" whose verse is regarded as oracular by those seeking guidance and attempting to realize wishes.A mere fraction of what is presumed to have been an extensive body of work survives. This collection is derived from Hafiz's Divan (collected poems), a classic of Sufism. The short poems, called ghazals, are sonnet-like arrangements of varied numbers of couplets. In the tradition of Persian poetry and Sufi philosophy, each poem corresponds to two interpretations, sensual and mystic.This outstanding translation of Hafiz's poetry was created by historian and Arabic scholar Gertrude Bell, who observed, \"These are the utterances of a great poet, the imaginative interpreter of the heart of man; they are not of one age, or of another, but for all time.\"\n", "genres": ["Iran", "Islam", "Literature", "Classics", "Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Spirituality", "Religion", "14th Century", "Philosophy", "Poetry"]}, "41745995": {"bookid": "41745995", "title": "Long Live Phoenixes", "author": "Jasmine Farrell", "series": "", "ratings": "15", "reviews": "8", "rating": "4.60", "description": "\"Long Live Phoenixes\" is Jasmine's third poetry collection.

But she never had any reason to worry about her longtime publisher, Lane Barfield, who also happens to be a trusted friend. When mounting evidence of financial malfeasance leads to an FBI investigation of Lane, Jessica can't believe what she's reading.So when Barfield turns up dead, Jessica takes on the task of proving Barfield's innocence--she can't fathom someone she's known and trusted for so long cheating her. Sure enough, Jessica's lone wolf investigation turns up several oddities and inconsistencies in Barfield's murder. Jessica knows something is being covered up, but what exactly? The trail she takes to answer that question reveals something far more nefarious afoot, involving shadowy characters from the heights of power in Washington. At the heart of Jessica's investigation lies a manuscript Barfield had intended to bring out after all other publishers had turned it down. The problem is that manuscript has disappeared, all traces of its submission and very existence having been wiped off the books.With her own life now in jeopardy, Jessica refuses to back off and sets her sights on learning the contents of that manuscript and what about it may have led to several murders.

Ultralearning offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education.\nIn these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education\u2014a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, Ultralearning offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention. Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself\u2014among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polg\u00e1r, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship\u2014without knowing French. Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs.Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success.\n", "genres": ["Education", "Audiobook", "Productivity", "Psychology", "Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Leadership", "Personal Development", "Business", "Science"]}, "55616375": {"bookid": "55616375", "title": "Spintec\u0103torul Sor\u021bii (Cartea Zeilor,#2)", "author": "Miruna Dr\u0103ghici", "series": "", "ratings": "5", "reviews": "0", "rating": "4.80", "description": "Cel de-al doilea volum al trilogiei ,,SPINTEC\u0102TORUL SOR\u021aII\u201d, intitulat ,,Cartea Zeilor\u201d, este un roman ce se adreseaz\u0103 tuturor v\u00e2rstelor: cei foarte tineri vor descoperi un volum heroic fantasy, inspirat din bogatul fond mitologic oriental iar cei ajun\u0219i la v\u00e2rsta maturit\u0103\u021bii culturale se vor delecta cu un roman ini\u021biatic, axat pe o profund\u0103 dram\u0103 mistic\u0103, av\u00e2nd ca miez na\nCel de-al doilea volum al trilogiei ,,SPINTEC\u0102TORUL SOR\u021aII\u201d, intitulat ,,Cartea Zeilor\u201d, este un roman ce se adreseaz\u0103 tuturor v\u00e2rstelor: cei foarte tineri vor descoperi un volum heroic fantasy, inspirat din bogatul fond mitologic oriental iar cei ajun\u0219i la v\u00e2rsta maturit\u0103\u021bii culturale se vor delecta cu un roman ini\u021biatic, axat pe o profund\u0103 dram\u0103 mistic\u0103, av\u00e2nd ca miez narativ singura lupt\u0103 care conteaz\u0103 - cea pentru sufletul omenesc.

But after she is captured by the fearsome space pirate, Captain Chainsword, Aerie is certain falling in love with her nation's arch enemy is the last possible way to earn their coveted esteem.\u00a0Driven by vengeance, Exton Shepherd never set out to save anyone. As he circles the war-torn world in his pirated starship, the Perdition, he only sees his father's ghost lurking around every corner and the looming darkness on the horizon. When Aerie unexpectedly tumbles into his life, he finds he cannot trust her, anymore than he can ignore her. But just like the raging war down on Earth, it's tempting to think he can ...\u00a0When the war ascends to the heights of the Perdition, Aerie's loyalty, and Exton's heart, are put to the test. But will love be enough to save them -- and others -- from certain destruction?FROM THE AUTHOR:\u00a0The Heights of Perdition is the first book in the Divine Space Pirates trilogy, a futuristic romance series where family, faith, and freedom all take center stage. With religious and political themes, this is one book sure to entertain your mind as much as it stimulates your heart. Look for Book 2, The Breadth of Creation, as the story - and the war - continues on!\n\n\nFROM THE BOOK:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTell me your name. It\u2019s a good place to start, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never give you any information. How could I, knowing what I know about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s more to me than you realize.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hateful monster! What else do I possibly need to know?\u201d\n\nAerie regretted her outburst less than a second later. The captain immediately left his chair and came close to her. Instinctively, she pulled back, but the pad behind her did not allow her to go far.\n\nAs he drew near, she got a good look at his face; though no longer adorned with the pirate\u2019s wig and beard, she could see he was still masked. The apathy, the cynicism, the playful whimsy\u2014all of it hid a deep crevice of pain inside of him.\n\nThe sudden urge to reach out and touch him shot through her. It was quickly followed by alarm and self-disgust.\n\n\u201cFrom your comments, I would assume you have yet to learn a great many things,\u201d he told her, his voice sharp.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d she asked, boldly meeting his gaze.\n\n\u201cFirst, your name is no small matter,\" he said. \"Destinies can be made and shaped by your name, though whether good or bad, it is up to you.\"\n\nHe turned away from her abruptly and began pacing by her bed. Aerie listened to his steps resonate with certainty and distinctness, like a military cadence, as she tried to breathe properly.\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d he continued, glancing at her from over his shoulder, \u201cDespite what you might think, I am not a monster; merely a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hardly see the difference,\u201d she retorted, still rattled by his presence.\n\n\u201cI would expect that, given your education with the URS. Over the past decade, your beloved Daddy Dictator has managed to ensure your education, rigorous as it is, consists of really only following instructions, repeating the lies they prefer to the truth, and ignoring any logic that would unravel them or undermine their authority.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT REVIEWERS ARE SAYING:\u00a0\n5 STARS! ~ Reader's Favorite Review\u00a0Questions raised about government, religion, and human nature were peppered throughout the narrative, elevating The Heights of Perdition from a mere space fantasy to something much more thought-provoking.\u00a0~ Author Jess Jesinghaus\u00a0\n4th Place in Best RF Christian Sci-Fi & Fantasy for 2018\n\n\n", "genres": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Dystopia", "Amazon", "Fantasy", "Business", "Christian", "Christian Fiction"]}, "34796986": {"bookid": "34796986", "title": "To The Falls", "author": "Heather  Renee", "series": "(The Falls Trilogy   #1)", "ratings": "234", "reviews": "74", "rating": "4.06", "description": "The Fates have chosen...

Although governments may presume to set \"prices,\" it is individuals who, by their actions and choices through competitive bidding for money, products, and services, actually determine \"prices\". Thus, Mises presents economics\u2014not as a study of material goods, services, and products\u2014but as a study of human actions. He sees the science of human action, praxeology, as a science of reason and logic, which recognizes a regularity in the sequence and interrelationships among market phenomena. Mises defends the methodology of praxeology against the criticisms of Marxists, socialists, positivists, and mathematical statisticians.Mises attributes the tremendous technological progress and the consequent increase in wealth and general welfare in the last two centuries to the introduction of liberal government policies based on free-market economic teachings, creating an economic and political environment which permits individuals to pursue their respective goals in freedom and peace. Mises also explains the futility and counter-productiveness of government attempts to regulate, control, and equalize all people's circumstances: \"Men are born unequal and ... it is precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization.\"Ludwig von Mises (1881\u20131973)\u00a0was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the Anschluss, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City. From 1948 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at New York University.Bettina Bien Greaves\u00a0is a former resident scholar, trustee, and longtime staff member of the Foundation for Economic Education. She\u00a0has written and lectured extensively on topics of free market economics. Her articles have appeared in such journals as Human Events, Reason, and The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty.

In stories written in the gothic tradition, narrators recount their descent into madness and despair. Through their investigations into the unexplained, they tug at the thin threads that separate our world from another of indescribable horror. \u2018\u201c Great God! I never dreamed of THIS!\u201d\u2019 screams occultist Harley Warren in \u2018The Statement of Randolph Carter\u2019, as he begs his companion to bury him alive. Another early piece, \u2018The Outsider\u2019 \u2013 a tragic and emotive evocation of loneliness and desolation \u2013 follows a man\u2019s escape from his castle in a desperate search for human contact, but the loathsome truth he discovers destroys his mind.In later tales, such as the iconic \u2018The Call of Cthulhu\u2019 and \u2018The Whisperer in Darkness\u2019, Lovecraft reaches into the cosmos, bridging the divide between horror and science fiction. The extra-terrestrial \u2018gods\u2019 and cursed histories that would emerge from these stories now form the cornerstones of Lovecraft\u2019s unique mythology: the Cthulhu Mythos. This fictional universe, built in large part by his friend and most ardent supporter August Derleth, has in the years since been reimagined in myriad forms, and continues to act as a haunted playground for countless illustrators, fans and authors.This edition, based on its sister limited edition, marries Lovecraft\u2019s best-known fiction with two modern masters of the macabre, the acclaimed artist Dan Hillier and author Alan Moore. In his beautifully crafted new preface, Moore finds Lovecraft at once at odds with and integral to the time in which he lived: \u2018the improbable embodiment of an estranged world in transition\u2019. Yet, despite his prejudices and parochialisms, he \u2018possessed a voice and a perspective both unique in modern literature\u2019.Hillier\u2019s six mesmerising, portal-like illustrations embrace the alien realities that lurk among the gambrel roofs of Lovecraft\u2019s landscapes. By splicing Victorian portraits and lithographs with cosmic and Lovecraftian symbolism, each piece \u2013 like the stories themselves \u2013 pulls apart the familiar to reveal what lies beneath.The edition itself shimmers with Lovecraft\u2019s \u2018unknown colours\u2019, bound in purple and greens akin to both the ocean depths and mysteries from outer space. The cover is embossed with a mystical design by Hillier, while a monstrous eye stares blankly from the slipcase.Content:1. Dagon2. The Statement of Randolph Carter3.

The JPS TANAKH is an entirely original translation of the Holy Scriptures into contemporary English, based on the Masoretic (the traditional Hebrew) text. It is the culmination of three decades of collaboration by academic scholars and rabbis, representing the three largest branches of organized Judaism in the United States. Not since the third century b.c.e., when 72 elders of the tribes of Israel created the Greek translation of Scriptures known as the Septuagint has such a broad-based committee of Jewish scholars produced a major Bible translation.In executing this monumental task, the translators made use of the entire range of biblical interpretation, ancient and modern, Jewish and non-Jewish. They drew upon the latest findings in linguistics and archaeology, as well as the work of early rabbinic and medieval commentators, grammarians, and philologians. The resulting text is a triumph of literary style and biblical scholarship, unsurpassed in accuracy and clarity.Ebook versions of this title may be purchased from most ebook vendors.\n", "genres": ["Reference", "Literature", "Classics", "Judaica", "Nonfiction", "Spirituality", "Religion", "Judaism", "Philosophy", "Jewish", "History"]}, "21402833": {"bookid": "21402833", "title": "Mistaken Kiss", "author": "Kathleen Baldwin", "series": "(My Notorious Aunt #2)", "ratings": "2733", "reviews": "278", "rating": "3.90", "description": "Willa is nearly blind, but she knows trouble when she trips over it.Willa, the vicar\u2019s little sister knows full well that her prospects are bleak.

The Muslim Scholars have agreed that all of the Ahadith in Sahih Muslim are authentic. Thus, Darussalam realized the great benefit of publishing the full version of Sahih Muslim in the English language in the best presentation. Much care has been taken in rendering these Ahadith into a clear and simple style of modern English.This fine-quality edition of Sahih Muslim has been verified by Dar-us-Salam Publications extensively. Its translation has been checked several times as not only to avoid mistranslating but also to avoid misinterpreting the ahadith as done by many translators of the current times in order to rush the product to market or to their lack of understanding of the Arabic language. Unlike other publishers which leave you wondering about the meaning of the ahadith, the unclear wording has been explained in the brackets. There are also footnotes on bottom of some of the pages, when the term cannot be explained in the brackets. This edition of Dar-us-Salam is nice in that it starts off by drawing a life sketch of Imam Muslim. Then, it goes on to the introduction of Sahih Muslim by Imam Muslim himself where he explains the difference between different narrators and level of trustworthiness.This edition is also different from other publishers in that the text is side by side with Arabic so you have access to both English and Arabic at the same time. Furthermore, the book regarding reporting from the trustworthy narrators have been placed first while other books follow it. Moreover, the Arabic text contains full chain of narrators while the English only mentions the companion. Lastly, in keeping with the tradition of high quality printing, this edition of Sahih Muslim by Dar-us-Salam Publications is second to none other & made to last a long time, Insha Allah.About Sahih MuslimThe authentic hadith collections of Bukhari and Muslim are excellent in respect to both chain of transmissions and the texts as well as their general utility in that they gave guidance in almost all walks of life. The collections won the praise and acclaim of of Hadith scholars so much that they themselves produced works containing the same Ahadith as found in the collection of both Bukhari and Muslim but with their own independent chains consisting of a lesser # of sub-narrators and called their works Mustakhraj.Imam Muslim is one of the foremost preservers of ahadith of the Prophet. His book comes second only to Sahih al Bukhari in terms of authenticity according to majority of scholars. It is considered to be better than Sahih Bukhari in terms of organization and repetition according to some scholars of Islam. It is the second in the collection of 6 books called \"Sihah Sittah\" or \"6 most authentic books\". Imam Muslim took painstaking efforts in preserving the words/actions/sayings & approvals of the Prophet. He has mostly used 4-5 narrators in the chain of transmission although there are a couple of hadith containing 3 narrators. Imam Muslim was a very good student of Imam Bukhari and some of his Shuyukhs, although he did not narrate from Imam Bukhari too much, thus reducing the # of narrators.Book Compiled by: Imam Abul Hussain Muslim Ibn Al-HajjajAhadith edited & referenced by: Hafiz Abu Tahir Zubair Ali ZaiTranslated by: Nasiruddin al-Khattab (Canada)Final Review by: Abu Khaliyl (USA)\n", "genres": ["Religion", "Nonfiction", "Islam"]}, "56335655": {"bookid": "56335655", "title": "Despite the Devil", "author": "Shawna  James", "series": "", "ratings": "23", "reviews": "16", "rating": "4.48", "description": "To Stephanie, Andrew Simmons seemed like the perfect man.

Leopold Bloom King, our narrator, is the son of an amiable, loving father who teaches science at the local high school. His mother, an ex-nun, is the high school principal and a well-known Joyce scholar. After Leo's older brother commits suicide at the age of thirteen, the family struggles with the shattering effects of his death, and Leo, lonely and isolated, searches for something to sustain him. Eventually, he finds his answer when he becomes part of a tightly knit group of high school seniors that includes friends Sheba and Trevor Poe, glamorous twins with an alcoholic mother and a prison-escapee father; hardscrabble mountain runaways Niles and Starla Whitehead; socialite Molly Huger and her boyfriend, Chadworth Rutledge X; and an ever-widening circle whose liaisons will ripple across two decades-from 1960s counterculture through the dawn of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. The ties among them endure for years, surviving marriages happy and troubled, unrequited loves and unspoken longings, hard-won successes and devastating breakdowns, and Charleston's dark legacy of racism and class divisions. But the final test of friendship that brings them to San Francisco is something no one is prepared for. South of Broad is Pat Conroy at his finest; a long-awaited work from a great American writer whose passion for life and language knows no bounds.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "American", "Young Adult", "Audiobook", "Southern", "Contemporary", "Historical", "Book Club", "Coming Of Age", "Adult Fiction", "Adult", "Historical Fiction", "Novels"]}, "1374307": {"bookid": "1374307", "title": "Tough Times Never Last, but Tough People Do!", "author": "Robert H.

Seventeen year old Rebecca Winters\u2019 main goal for ten years has been to graduate high school and take down the people who killed her parents. When she stumbled upon a werewolf pack in the middle of Phoenix, she knew she\u2019d found a way to make her dream come true. Instead of getting vengeance, an act of war has put her into a position of power and forces her to put her thirst for family justice on a temporary hold. He is duty bound to protect her. Lucian (Lucky) Lamont is a member of the Protectors, an elite supernatural police force who works for the Authority. Their main goal is to keep humans in the dark about the creatures who live among them. Lucky is assigned to protect and manage Rebecca, despite her refusal of help. His cover is simple; he poses as the dutiful \u2018pretend\u2019 boyfriend in order to keep an eye on the new alpha wolf. She is his mate. Gabriel Black though taking his pack back from the witch who was chosen as the new alpha would be simple. He thought wrong. His entire world was turned upside down the moment he met Rebecca at the Authority Council meeting\u2026and he was hooked the moment he kissed her to prove she wasn\u2019t dating his best friend, Lucky. It\u2019s like being torn between two lovers. Rebecca is pulled in hundreds of different directions while she attempts to find a way to survive the supernatural world, protect her family, and discover who massacred her entire pack days before her first transformation. She doesn\u2019t have time for romance. But the heart wants what the heart wants. And the wolf gets what the wolf wants \u2013 or so her alpha believes. While Rebecca manages to keep her head above water as she unlocks political and family secrets which could destroy her, she loses sight of the most important people in her life and one of them pays the ultimate price.\n", "genres": ["Romance", "Young Adult", "Shapeshifters", "Paranormal", "Supernatural", "Fantasy", "Vampires", "Werewolves", "Paranormal Romance", "Thriller", "Urban Fantasy"]}, "20877620": {"bookid": "20877620", "title": "Hart Attack", "author": "Cristin Harber", "series": "(Titan #5)", "ratings": "2724", "reviews": "169", "rating": "4.40", "description": "Outside of Titan Group, there are few people that Roman Hart would die for.

Now, in Half Broke Horses, she brings us the story of her grandmother, told in a first-person voice that is authentic, irresistible, and triumphant. \"Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did.\" So begins the story of Lily Casey Smith, Jeannette Walls's no nonsense, resourceful, and spectacularly compelling grandmother. By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town -- riding five hundred miles on her pony, alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car (\"I loved cars even more than I loved horses. They didn't need to be fed if they weren't working, and they didn't leave big piles of manure all over the place\") and fly a plane. And, with her husband Jim, she ran a vast ranch in Arizona. She raised two children, one of whom is Jeannette's memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle. Lily survived tornadoes, droughts, floods, the Great Depression, and the most heartbreaking personal tragedy. She bristled at prejudice of all kinds -- against women, Native Americans, and anyone else who didn't fit the mold. Rosemary Smith Walls always told Jeannette that she was like her grandmother, and in this true-life novel, Jeannette Walls channels that kindred spirit. Half Broke Horses is Laura Ingalls Wilder for adults, as riveting and dramatic as Isak Dinesen's Out of Africa or Beryl Markham's West with the Night.

Blackmon brings to light one of the most shameful chapters in American history\u2014an \u201cAge of Neoslavery\u201d that thrived from the aftermath of the Civil War through the dawn of World War II.Under laws enacted specifically to intimidate blacks, tens of thousands of African Americans were arbitrarily arrested, hit with outrageous fines, and charged for the costs of their own arrests. With no means to pay these ostensible \u201cdebts,\u201d prisoners were sold as forced laborers to coal mines, lumber camps, brickyards, railroads, quarries, and farm plantations. Thousands of other African Americans were simply seized by southern landowners and compelled into years of involuntary servitude. Government officials leased falsely imprisoned blacks to small-town entrepreneurs, provincial farmers, and dozens of corporations\u2014including U.S. Steel\u2014looking for cheap and abundant labor. Armies of \u201cfree\u201d black men labored without compensation, were repeatedly bought and sold, and were forced through beatings and physical torture to do the bidding of white masters for decades after the official abolition of American slavery.The neoslavery system exploited legal loopholes and federal policies that discouraged prosecution of whites for continuing to hold black workers against their wills. As it poured millions of dollars into southern government treasuries, the new slavery also became a key instrument in the terrorization of African Americans seeking full participation in the U.S. political system.Based on a vast record of original documents and personal narratives, Slavery by Another Name unearths the lost stories of slaves and their descendants who journeyed into freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation and then back into the shadow of involuntary servitude. It also reveals the stories of those who fought unsuccessfully against the re-emergence of human labor trafficking, the modern companies that profited most from neoslavery, and the system\u2019s final demise in the 1940s, partly due to fears of enemy propaganda about American racial abuse at the beginning of World War II.Slavery by Another Name is a moving, sobering account of a little-known crime against African Americans, and the insidious legacy of racism that reverberates today.\n", "genres": ["African American", "North American Hi...", "Anti Racist", "American History", "Social Justice", "Nonfiction", "Historical", "Race", "Cultural", "Social Movements", "History", "Politics", "Sociology"]}, "73888": {"bookid": "73888", "title": "The Adventure of English: The Biography of a Language", "author": "Melvyn Bragg", "series": "", "ratings": "4609", "reviews": "487", "rating": "3.95", "description": "English is the collective work of millions of people throughout the ages.

This, in part, is the question that G.K. Chesterton starts with in this classic exploration of human history. Responding to the evolutionary materialism of his contemporary (and antagonist) H.G. Wells, Chesterton in this work affirms human uniqueness and the unique message of the Christian faith. Writing in a time when social Darwinism was rampant, Chesterton instead argued that the idea that society has been steadily progressing from a state of primitivism and barbarity towards civilization is simply and flatly inaccurate. \"Barbarism and civilization were not successive stages in the progress of the world,\" he affirms, with arguments drawn from the histories of both Egypt and Babylon.  As always with Chesterton, there is in this analysis something (as he said of Blake) \"very plain and emphatic.\" He sees in Christianity a rare blending of philosophy and mythology, or reason and story, which satisfies both the mind and the heart. On both levels it rings true. As he puts it, \"in answer to the historical query of why it was accepted, and is accepted, I answer for millions of others in my reply; because it fits the lock; because it is like life.\" Here, as so often in Chesterton, we sense a lived, awakened faith.

For the love of God, what are we doing about it?\"In this open letter, Irshad Manji unearths the troubling cornerstones of mainstream Islam today: tribal insularity, deep-seated anti-Semitism, and an uncritical acceptance of the Koran as the final, and therefore superior, manifesto of God's will. But her message is ultimately positive. She offers a practical vision of how Islam can undergo a reformation that empowers women, promotes respect for religious minorities, and fosters a competition of ideas. Her vision revives \"ijtihad,\" Islam's lost tradition of independent thinking. In that spirit, Irshad has a refreshing challenge for both Muslims and non-Muslims: Don't silence yourselves. Ask questions---out loud. The Trouble with Islam Today is a clarion call for a fatwa-free future.\n", "genres": ["Islam", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Religion", "Spirituality", "Philosophy", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Feminism", "Politics"]}, "2924318": {"bookid": "2924318", "title": "Home", "author": "Marilynne Robinson", "series": "(Gilead #2)", "ratings": "24548", "reviews": "3675", "rating": "4.03", "description": "Home parallels the story told in Robinson's Pulitzer Prize-winning Gilead.

Glory Boughton, aged thirty-eight, has returned to Gilead to care for her dying father. Soon her brother, Jack\u2014the prodigal son of the family, gone for twenty years\u2014comes home too, looking for refuge and trying to make peace with a past littered with tormenting trouble and pain. Jack is one of the great characters in recent literature.

Brilliant, lovable, and wayward, Jack forges an intense bond with Glory and engages painfully with Ames, his godfather and namesake.
