The island was a natural fortress, separated from the mainland by a narrow strait of freezing water and deadly currents. This prison was the U.S. government's drastic answer to the lawlessness unleashed under Prohibition, which continued throughout the \"Roaring Twenties\" and into the teeth of the Great Depression. Alcatraz, with its damp cold and austere isolation, its rigid discipline and strict rule of silence, was as tough as the criminals that were sent there, and by the time the prison closed down in 1963, \"the Rock\" had indisputably done its job.Alcatraz - A History of the Penitentiary Years has sustained as a staple reference for staff members on Alcatraz and remains one of the most comprehensive references chronicling the history. This mammoth reference navigates the island's history through rarely seen documents, interviews and hundreds of pages of historic photographs. Author interviews range from men such as legendary FBI fugitive James \"Whitey' Bulger; Dale Stamphill, a principle in the 1938 escape with Doc Barker and Henry Young; to Atom Spy Morton Sobell, the codefendant of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.Michael Esslinger thoroughly details the prominent events, inmates, and life inside the most infamous prison in American History. His research included hundreds of hours examining actual Alcatraz inmate case files (including rare original documents from Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly, and over a hundred others) exploring the prison grounds from the rooftop to the waterfront to help retrace events, escape routes, in addition to conducting various interviews with former inmates & guards. Esslinger interviewed a variety of principle figures, comprised of both convicts and officers who were either involved, on-duty, or on Alcatraz during nearly escape attempt. Interviews included prisoners and officers that covered each era of operations at Alcatraz from the early military period in the late 1920's, through the federal years, 1934 to 1963.His study has resulted in detailed accounts of all the recorded escape attempts including the Battle of Alcatraz. A detailed account of the 1962 escape of Frank Morris and the Anglin Brothers provides rare insight extracted through photos, and over 1,700 pages of FBI and Bureau of Prisons investigative notes.Detailed narratives of Alcatraz's most notable inmates who include Robert Stroud (Birdman of Alcatraz), Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly, Frank Morris, the Anglin Brothers, Doc Barker, Joe Cretzer, Bernard Coy, Miran Thompson, Sam Shockley, and many-many others. Alcatraz: The History of the Penitentiary Years, is a comprehensive reference on the history of Alcatraz and contains one of the most comprehensive archives of inmate and prison life photographs (over 1,000).WARNING: This book contains graphic depictions of extreme crime and violence and may not be suitable for all readers.\n", "genres": ["Historical", "Biography", "Crime", "Mystery", "Nonfiction", "True Crime", "Research", "History", "Reference"]}, "15702273": {"bookid": "15702273", "title": "Cracks in the Pavement", "author": "Martin  Hopkins", "series": "", "ratings": "6", "reviews": "4", "rating": "3.33", "description": "Jekyll & Hyde for the 21st Century.

The majority of his time is spent in various pubs throughout the capital, discussing the world with his friends and where it all went wrong.On his reluctant walks to work, Dan notices there are an abundance of people sleeping rough on the streets, begging for money. He feels empathy for those less fortunate and tries to help them when he can. Realisation quickly dawns on him that not everyone claiming to be homeless is genuine - often it is merely a scam; free money to spend on drugs, alcohol and other addictions.When his love interest, Emily, is attacked by a 'Dark Stranger', Dan must infiltrate an underground street community, to catch the elusive attacker. He gets caught in a deadly game of survival as he hunts for the attacker and is hunted himself.

The Little Locksmith begins in 1895 when a specialist straps five-year-old Katharine, then suffering from spinal tuberculosis, to a board with halters and pulleys in a failed attempt to prevent her being a \"hunchback.\" Her mother says that she should be thankful that her parents are able to have her cared for by a famous surgeon; otherwise, she would grow up to be like the \"little locksmith,\" who does jobs at their home; he has a \"strange, awful peak in his back.\" Forced to endure \"a horizontal life of night and day,\" Katharine remains immobile until age fifteen, only to find that she, too, has a hunched back and is \"no larger than a ten-year-old child.\" The Little Locksmith charts Katharine's struggle to transcend physical limitations and embrace her life, her body and herself in the face of debilitating bouts of frustration and shame. Her spirit and courage prevail, and she succeeds in expanding her world far beyond the boundaries prescribed by her family and society: she attends Radcliffe College, forms deep friendships, begins to write, and in 1921, purchases a house of her own in Castine, Maine. There she creates her home, room by room, fashioning it as a space for guests, lovers, and artists. The Little Locksmith stands as a testimony to Katharine's aspirations and desires-for independence, for love, and for the pursuit of her art.\"We tend to forget nowadays that there is more than one variety of hero (and heroine). Katharine Butler Hathaway, who died last Christmas Eve, was the kind of heroine whose deeds are rarely chronicled. They were not spectacular and no medal would have been appropriate for her.

The book reveals extraordinary tales of passionate Chefs as they compete in the Medallion d\u2019Oro, crowning the greatest cuisinier in America. High spirited, intelligent and spicy, this is the delicious story of Pacomino Oakley always called Paco. Leading an unbridled lifestyle among the rich and famous, he stumbled into a plot that exposed his true identity, all while uncovering his artistic talents and following a path to solve the puzzle of his mysterious first love. Born into a family of noted stonemasons and artisans imported from Italy for their remarkable skills, he grew up watching the creation of multi-million dollar estates, sitting like castles on the verdant soft summits of Santa Barbara and Montecito, California in the 1920's. The boy had an inauspicious birth secreted away in the beginning since his rolling stone of a father evaporated upon knowledge of his coming. Paco was the only thing that made his Mother\u2019s beautiful mahogany-colored eyes sparkle with joy. She sang to him in Italian, fed him tenderly from her large perfect breasts and made him darling baby dresses of vintage lace with satin bows. She taught him to dance and to paint on a big white china platter in strawberry jam with his tiny fingers. Given all this loving attention Paco\u2019s eyes sparkled too, just like hers, with an adorable little crinkle at the outside corners that gave the impression he was always smiling. His soft brown curls matched his eyes and sprang out in ringlets that his Mother made perfect by wrapping strands around her fingers. The boy grew to a man, still painting, only now with fine sable brushes, with the same crinkly laughing eyes but the curls were carefully oiled to lay stark and flat with a part down the center according to the current fashion. He moved with a graceful agile gait, athletic and suntanned, a bearing unique to California. While he worked he wore a handsome uniform of dark blue lightweight serge with small brass buttons and epaulets. Paco\u2019s trousers were slim tan jodhpurs and he was finished with a pair of dutifully polished sable knee high boots. He put on a fresh white shirt each day and an Eaton tie peeked out of his collar.A breed of super wealthy Americans, called \u201cThe Hill Barons\u201d, were Paco\u2019s patrons, the ones, Diehls, the foremost gourmet market in the region, handled with kid gloves. Earnestly searching the globe for their requests, Paco supplied the fabulous kitchens where all was converted to luxurious dining, extravagant parties and exquisite events. At 6:00am each morning Paco always stocked a fine highly polished black truck displaying the famous Diehls trademark in gold script on the side. The world's best fresh food and culinary delicacies were fulfilled, following the orders of a wild, eccentric and often hilarious assortment of Chefs and cooks.Follow the fireworks aboard an infamous gambling ship and experience the opening of Santa Barbara's prized Biltmore Hotel. Be entertained by the steady stream of notables, from Lindbergh and Chaplin to sexy starlets of the silver screen who flood the Santa Barbara social scene with excitement, celebrity and scandal. An ardent lover of the richness and artistry before him, Paco dreams of studying in the Academy del Arte of Florence as he sees his complex world explode with intrigue, sensual pleasures and tangled relationships.

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?In How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins' research project\u2014more than four years in duration\u2014uncovered five step-wise stages of decline:Stage 1: Hubris Born of SuccessStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of MoreStage 3: Denial of Risk and PerilStage 4: Grasping for SalvationStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or DeathBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.Great companies can stumble, badly, and recover.Every institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins' research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover\u2014in some cases, coming back even stronger\u2014even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.Decline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands.

He firmly believes that while our earnings show how we make a living, our contributions to the society show how we make a life. A little about what this book is all about - For me, life had always been a game of choices. It is a game of perceptions that we draw everyday within our minds and their associated outlook. To some, life has always been \"half-full\" while to others; it has been \"half-empty.\" Through this book, I can guarantee that one can easily solder wire the brain to look only for the \"half-full\" side that our life has to offer. It is not a book of DOs and DONTs, neither it is some kind of a rulebook nor does it unveil the secret recipe of \"that\" magic potion we had been searching for years. The book, in reality, is a beautiful compilation of my personal and professional experiences and describes the various teachings that Life offered to me during all these years. I was always taught that to become wise, you have to make decisions in the form of choices. If your choice is good, it will help you climb a step ahead on the life ladder. But if it backfires, then a unique opportunity is offered to un-learn and re-learn it in such a manner that makes you successful on its next application. Life is not only stranger than we can imagine, it is more mysterious; one which is like a riddle wrapped in an enigma. Life is also the single-most complex phenomenon to understand after the human brain. Each of us has a unique life to live and each one of us deal with it even more uniquely making it almost impossible to have one size that fits all. However, the book would surely help us create a framework which can help all of us lead and live our life better, happily and blissfully.\n", "genres": ["Self Help", "Short Stories", "Nonfiction"]}, "15785898": {"bookid": "15785898", "title": "White Lilies in Autumn", "author": "Dustin W.

September, 11, 2001, defined tragedy for a generation. On that day Deepak Chopra found himself driving from city to city, meeting thousands of people who begged for meaning and solace in the face of suffering. In response he has written The Deeper Wound, offering a way of healing as a memorial to the thousands of victims who perished.The opening section, \u201cIn the Face of Tragedy,\u201d defines suffering as the pain that threatens to make life meaningless. When our deepest needs go unfulfilled, suffering begins. We begin to heal when we go beyond personal anger and fear to a realization of our true self, the self that was never afraid and can never be wounded.The true self contains the light that no darkness can attack. Having described a path of awareness and compassion that leads to the light, the second half of The Deeper Wound takes us there through \u201cA Hundred Days of Healing,\u201d daily affirmations, exercises, insights, lessons, and questions\u2014each a step out of pain toward a higher reality. \u201cWe can become living memorials to tragedy by restoring the power of life,\u201d writes Deepak Chopra. \u201cYou are that life, you are that power. Let us see if we can find the spark that will make the spiritual flame spring up.\u201dHealing yourself comes in two stages\u2014first releasing the energy of suffering, then replacing it with the soul\u2019s energy.

We watched together as the plane taxied down the runway, leaving with his new gloves still aboard. He looked at me with disappointment, reached for the packet of adoption papers that I carried under my arm and wordlessly took it from me.

She's never walked its hedge maze nor found its secret chambers; she's never glimpsed the shades that haunt it, nor hunted for lost diamonds in its walls. But all of that is about to change. After her grandmother passes away, Sarah and her friend Jackson decide to search for the diamonds--and the house comes alive. She discovers that she can see visions of the house's past, like the eighteenth-century sea captain who hid the jewels, or the glamorous great-grandmother driven mad by grief. She grows closer to both Jackson and a young man named Richard Hathaway, whose family histories are each deeply entwined with her own. But when the visions start to threaten the person she holds most dear, Sarah must do everything she can to get to the bottom of the house's secrets, and stop the course of history before it is cemented forever.\n", "genres": ["Gothic", "Historical", "Time Travel", "Science Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Young Adult", "Romance", "Ghosts", "Mystery", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Paranormal"]}, "3977275": {"bookid": "3977275", "title": "Discovering Pig Magic", "author": "Julie Crabtree", "series": "", "ratings": "75", "reviews": "20", "rating": "3.19", "description": "Discovering Pig Magic follows the exploits of Mattie (or Miss M, or just M) and her friends Ariel and Nicki as they attempt to overcome the problems that plague their 13-year-old lives.

After finding a book of spells, the three girls perform a ritual that will grant each the object of her desire. This requires that they each bury a special object. Ariel buries a tiny antique spoon; Nicki puts in a thumb-sized leather mother-and-child doll; and Miss M contributes a small ceramic pig with real gold inlays. When the magic starts to take effect, the girls' longed-for wishes carry unintended, and unwelcome, consequences. Breaking the spell before something really bad happens becomes crucial, but doing so may be too much even for these resourceful friends.

That night, in the few minutes it takes to play a hard-rock standard, the fate of many of the unsuspecting nightclub patrons was determined with awful certainty. The blaze was ignited when pyrotechnics set off by Great White, a 1980s heavy-metal band, lit flammable polyurethane \"egg crate\" foam sound insulation on the club's walls. In less than 10 minutes, 96 people were dead and 200 more were injured, many catastrophically. The final death toll topped out, three months later, at the eerily unlikely round number of 100.The story of the fire, its causes, and its legal and human aftermath is one of lives put at risk by petty economic decisions\u2014by a band, club owners, promoters, building inspectors, and product manufacturers. Any one of those decisions, made differently, might have averted the tragedy. Together, however, they reached a fatal critical mass.Killer Show is the first comprehensive exploration of the chain of events leading up to the fire, the conflagration itself, and the painstaking search for evidence to hold the guilty to account and obtain justice for the victims. Anyone who has entered an entertainment venue and wondered, \"Could I get out of here in a hurry?\" will identify with concertgoers at The Station. Fans of disaster nonfiction and forensic thrillers will find ample elements of both genres in Killer Show.\n", "genres": ["Music", "Tragedy", "Crime", "Science", "Adventure", "Mystery", "Survival", "Nonfiction", "True Crime", "History"]}, "165661": {"bookid": "165661", "title": "The Mystical City of God (4 Volume Set)", "author": "Mary of Agreda", "series": "", "ratings": "167", "reviews": "9", "rating": "4.66", "description": "Written by Venerable Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas de Agreda, a 17th century Spanish nun, after years of private revelations from God the Father and Most Holy Mary, M\u00edstica Ciudad de Dios (The Mystical City of God) is a marvelous and life-changing narrative of most wonderful and hidden mysteries about the life of Most Holy Mary and his Son Jesus Our Lord that has been enthralling readers\nWritten by Venerable Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas de Agreda, a 17th century Spanish nun, after years of private revelations from God the Father and Most Holy Mary, M\u00edstica Ciudad de Dios (The Mystical City of God) is a marvelous and life-changing narrative of most wonderful and hidden mysteries about the life of Most Holy Mary and his Son Jesus Our Lord that has been enthralling readers for centuries.Composed of the Conception, Incarnation, Transfixion and Coronation, this magnificent narrative takes the reader through the various stages of the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary, plus it reveals all sorts of facts about our entire salvation history.Pope Innocent XI and Pope Alexander VIII in 1690 expressly declared that the City of God may be read by all the faithful.

Kidnapped as a young boy and sold into slavery by a power-hungry mobster, he has thought of nothing but vengeance. For twelve years he has immersed himself in the world of pleasure slaves searching for the one man he holds ultimately responsible. Finally, the architect of his suffering has emerged with a new identity, but not a new nature. If Caleb is to get close enough to strike, he must become the very thing he abhors and kidnap a beautiful girl to train her to be all that he once was.Eighteen-year-old Olivia Ruiz has just woken up in a strange place.

You will discover the philosophy of the rich, the philosophy of the poor and powerful success strategies. You will learn how to re-program your thinking and how to overcome money-making limitations. Just as you can be a good mechanic, a good accountant, a good shop assistant or whatever you are, you can be financially very successful.Extract:You Need To Acquire A Philosophy: There is a philosophy of the rich and a philosophy of the poor. I very deliberately did not say \"you need to acquire a money making philosophy\" \u2013 although this is indeed what you need. But that's not all. You need more. You need a money making philosophy in order to create wealth, there is no question about that. However, at this point you also have to ask yourself: what is it all about? How is it going to contribute to a life well lived? What is a life well lived? Your money making philosophy has to be compatible with whatever else is important in your life \u2013 your relationships, your sense of integrity, your spiritual beliefs, your social life, your recreational needs and so on. In other words, you need to create a philosophy of your life that supports your money making ambitions in a way that is not in conflict with your fundamental values and beliefs of what your life well lived is really all about. If there is a conflict, it will work against you \u2013 the emotions resulting from this conflict will consciously and subconsciously have a negative impact on both your money making potential and your ability to enjoy life. It is very important that you get your whole life under control, that you develop a philosophy that supports not only your money making ambitions but your entire existence.

Imagine you feel no tension or stress whatsoever, neither in mind, body, or spirit. Your entire psyche is enveloped in peace and comfort.Nothing bothers you.Outside noises are meaningless. Time is meaningless. You move through life with complete serenity, utterly unperturbed by whatever beings and sounds exist around you.Here is the good news: if your son or daughter is autistic, that is where they live, in that beautiful, peaceful, totally comfortable world. Nothing bothers them; nothing causes them pain or disrupts their contentment\u2014until you or someone else intrudes on their private space.John Hall's son lives there. Even when John's son is pushed or pulled out of his altered state of consciousness, he avoids connecting with his father, his mother, his sister, and everyone else. Unless someone interacts with him in his face every moment, John's son retreats into his private world where he is perfectly happy, completely safe, and thoroughly comfortable.His father and the book's author, John Hall knows exactly how he feels.He used to live there, too.In Am I Still Autistic?: How a Low-Functioning, Slightly Retarded Toddler Became CEO of a Multi-Million Dollar National Corporation, John chronicles how he overcame autism, what it was like, the pain of moving from his autistic state to the mainstream world, things he had to learn that most people take for granted, and what he was able to accomplish against all odds. John was able to eventually make friends, graduate from high school, put himself through college, earn his MBA, start a successful company, and start a family!Overcoming autism was only part of his battle though. John writes about how many of his most significant life challenges began after he began to emerge from his autistic shell - some which lingered long into John's adult life, despite his many successes. But when John's own son was diagnosed with autism in 2007, John's life was shattered. He will never forget how he sobbed as his son's neurologist handed down his son's diagnosis. At that moment, John experienced the same sense of hopelessness that most parents do when they receive such a diagnosis. And there was so much more. He immediately thought of the hurt, pain, loneliness he experienced growing up, how hard it was to learn how to look at people and to communicate with them, how scary it all was, and how the entire experience follows him to this day. John was heart-broken that his son would be relegated to have the same experiences.For years, John could hardly say the word autistic when talking about my son. He was not ashamed of his beautiful boy in anyway. John just couldn't hear himself say the word, \"autistic\" in the same sentence as his little boy's name. John was in denial. Writing this book has allowed him to face his son's diagnosis head on and has restored his hope. With this book, John hopes to provide inspiration to so many others who have been affected by autism - parents, educators, therapists, and loved ones of those with autism. Autism does not have to be a life sentence. Love, persistence, and support make all the difference in the world. It is why John is who he is today and why he knows his son will be able to write a book about how he overcame autism one day!As science seeks to develop a \u201ccure\u201d for autism, John seeks to expand autism awareness and hope. Rather than highlighting autism symptoms and treatment options, John's book puts a human face on the disorder. Am I Still Autistic? provides a unique perspective on autism \u2013 told by someone who has experienced it firsthand.Whether you are a parent of an autistic or special-needs child, a teacher, therapist, or family member, this book will provide fresh context on what it is like to be autistic and how anything is possible. Even if you are not affected by autism, this book will move and inspire you!\n", "genres": []}, "7642882": {"bookid": "7642882", "title": "Be D.R.A.M.A.T.I.C.(TM) or No One Will Care !: Managing Change in Organizations", "author": "Kevin J.

It was written, he learns, over two thousand years ago by a man believed by a select few to have been a mysterious thirteenth apostle of Christ. When the disturbing prophecies of the scroll are revealed to Father Joseph he is certain the end of days for man is here and he is compelled to embark upon a journey around the world on a quest to save the soul of mankind. He is unaware that Glenn, an angel from the highest order of heaven, has already descended to earth to determine whether man has finally and completely emptied his soul of purity of heart of his own free will. If so, man's demise is imminent. Glenn's work is interrupted when the underworld sends Falene to place a well thought out, diabolical wager with the angel; find the last soul on earth with the purest of heart then turn him or her over to her to be tested. In no other way could the true resolve of mankind be measured. Glenn accepts the bet. If he loses, then all of humanity will be turned over to hell, the abode of the devils where the wicked dwell. When the chosen one is selected as the ultimate representative for all and stripped to his or her core and put to tests a hero would beg to be spared, can he or she rise up against evil in it's most intimidating form to prove that goodness still exists within the heart of mankind? The 13th Apostle begs readers to consider whether mankind is inherently good or evil and where they fall along that often very fine line.

Like many others, he blamed all the problems on \"white people.\"Beth Ward grew up in a middle-class home in the suburbs. Raised in a politically left family, she also believed that all problems on the reservation originated with cruel treatment by settlers and the stealing of land. Meeting Wilson, her first close experience with a tribal member, she stepped out of the comfort of suburban life into a whole new, frightening world.After almost ten years of living with Wilson's alcoholism and the terrible dangers that came with it, they both came to realize that individual behavior and personal decisions were at the root of a man's troubles, including their own. Further, corrupt tribal government, dishonest federal Indian policy, and the controlling reservation system had more to do with the current despair in his community than what had happened 150 years ago.Here is the plain truth in the eyes of one family, in the hope that at least some of the dying-physical, emotional, and spiritual-may be recognized and prevented.What cannot be denied is that a large number of Native Americans are dying from alcoholism, drug abuse, suicide, and violence. Popular belief is that the white culture and its past sins are to blame. However, tribal government as it behaves today, coupled with current federal Indian policy, may have more to do with the present condition.Unfortunately, persistent public misconceptions about Indian Country, misconceptions sometimes promoted by tribal government and others enjoying unaudited money and power, have worked to keep the situation just as it is.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Native American History", "History"]}, "14287904": {"bookid": "14287904", "title": "The Hairdresser Diaries", "author": "Jessica  Miller", "series": "", "ratings": "30", "reviews": "7", "rating": "3.77", "description": "For Tatum, love has always been something to keep at a distance.

It is a place for you to clarify goals, visualize the future, and focus your engergies; a means of freeing your intuition and imagination; a workbook for exploring your dreams, your past, and your present life.It is for everyone seeking concrete methods for dealing with personal problems. It is for women and men interested in achieving self-reliance and inner liberation, for artists and writers seeking new techniques for overcoming blocks to creativity.\n", "genres": ["Diary", "Self Help", "Research", "How To", "Reference", "Nonfiction", "Journal", "Writing", "Psychology", "Language", "Journaling"]}, "16139983": {"bookid": "16139983", "title": "The Meaning Of Theft", "author": "Peter O'Mahoney", "series": "", "ratings": "41", "reviews": "5", "rating": "3.51", "description": "David's urban routine is interrupted by an unexpected moment of thievery and he is instantly obsessed with the excitement it unleashes.

Five years later, he is released from a psychiatric facility and his circle of friends overlap with those of Hannah, the girl he maimed. He finds himself drawn to her, sadistically at first, but after Jared, an acquaintance from the hospital, covets her for his own disturbing uses, Matt struggles to protect her. Hannah's an outcast, not only because of the scars Matt gave her, but because of the ones she's given herself, too. Matt's heroin addiction and the way he exploits her body harm her in places sharp objects can't touch. Fearful that a dark secret will be disclosed, and with his addiction to heroin worsening, Matt chooses to abandon Hannah, allowing her to fall prey to Jared. Jared is a sociopath obsessed with a fantasy that Hannah can fly...a theory he plans on forcing her to test, even if the cost is her life. Vein Fire gives a startling portrait of Hannah, a young woman with Borderline Personality Disorder. This dark, voyeuristic story exposes the dysfunction she surrounds herself with as a method of self-harm. Its beautifully written passages will haunt the reader, compelling them to learn the fate of the girl who couldn't say no.

This young Jewish couple\u2014he a graduate student in theater, and she a doctor\u2014was poor but resolute. Risking their own lives and relying on false papers, the Abadis hid Jewish children in Catholic schools and convents and with Protestant families. In 1943, their clandestine organization\u2014the Marcel Network\u2014became one of the most successful operations of Jewish resistance in Europe. By the end of the war, 527 children owed their survival to the Abadis. Yet their improbable success came with almost unspeakable sacrifice. As an example of what just two people of good will can accomplish in the face of crimes against humanity, the Abadis' story is a lesson in moral and physical courage. Drawn from a multitude of sources, including hundreds of documents in the Abadis' archives and dozens of interviews with the now grown children they rescued, Fred Coleman tells the Abadis' full story for the first time. The Marcel Network also breaks historic ground, and reveals how the Catholic Church, French Christians, and Jews themselves did far more to save Jewish lives than is generally known.\n", "genres": ["Holocaust", "World War II", "France", "War", "Cultural", "Nonfiction", "History"]}, "17087184": {"bookid": "17087184", "title": "Nirupa and the Book of Shadows", "author": "Leora Cika Waldman", "series": "", "ratings": "19", "reviews": "5", "rating": "4.63", "description": "Description Nirupa has an interesting life, traveling around the world with her mother.

For Evola the physical conquest of a mountain, with all the courage, self-transcendence and mental lucidity that it entails, becomes an inseparable and complementary part of spiritual awakening. It is no coincidence that many ancient cultures chose mountains as the abodes of their gods and considered the rigorous ascent of peaks as the task of heroes and initiates. In modern times, which tend to suffocate the heroic with naked self interest, the mountain still forms part of the profound dimension of spirit where the soul finds within itself more than what it thought itself to be.

A gentle, solitary man, he finds solace and purpose in the sweetness of the apples, apricots, and plums he grows, and in the quiet, beating heart of the land--the valley of yellow grass bordering a deep canyon that has been his home since he was nine years old. Everything he is and has known is tied to this patch of earth. It is where his widowed mother is buried, taken by illness when he was just thirteen, and where his only companion, his beloved teenaged sister Elsbeth, mysteriously disappeared. It is where the horse wranglers--native men, mostly Nez Perce--pass through each spring with their wild herds, setting up camp in the flowering meadows between the trees.One day, while in town to sell his fruit at the market, two girls, barefoot and dirty, steal some apples. Later, they appear on his homestead, cautious yet curious about the man who gave them no chase. Feral, scared, and very pregnant, Jane and her sister Della take up on Talmadage's land and indulge in his deep reservoir of compassion. Yet just as the girls begin to trust him, brutal men with guns arrive in the orchard, and the shattering tragedy that follows sets Talmadge on an irrevocable course not only to save and protect them, putting himself between the girls and the world, but to reconcile the ghosts of his own troubled past.Writing with breathtaking precision and empathy, Amanda Coplin has crafted an astonishing debut novel about a man who disrupts the lonely harmony of an ordered life when he opens his heart and lets the world in. Transcribing America as it once was before railways and roads connected its corners, she weaves a tapestry of solitary souls who come together in the wake of unspeakable cruelty and misfortune, bound by their search to discover the place they belong. At once intimate and epic, evocative and atmospheric, filled with haunting characters both vivid and true to life, and told in a distinctive narrative voice, The Orchardist marks the beginning of a stellar literary career.The National Book Foundation selected Amanda Coplin as one of the authors being honored as \"5 Under 35\" in 2013.\n", "genres": ["Westerns", "Historical", "Adult", "Literary Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Audiobook", "Adult Fiction", "Novels", "Fiction", "Book Club"]}, "17562618": {"bookid": "17562618", "title": "Twisted Love: The Mayan Legend Returns", "author": "Fernando Lachica", "series": "", "ratings": "2", "reviews": "0", "rating": "4.00", "description": "A virgin....A stranger...The werewolves....their love and union triggered the unending war buried beneath the face of mankind.

From Mars to some of Jupiter\u2019s satellites to remote dwarf planet Pluto human civilizations have proliferated rapidly since the first spaceships appeared in the skies of earth in the first quarter of the twenty first century that took humanity\u2019s ancestors from earth to the other planets of the solar system. The Federal Government was the dominant power in the solar system with a governing body comprising a senator each from all the nations of the system. That being the case the Government was powerful enough to carry out just about anything it wanted; in this instance the highly enigmatic development of cosmic starships. The seat of the Federation \u2013 as the Federal Government was officially labeled \u2013 was located on a five acre complex in the city of Prague. It comprised the President\u2019s office building, the state building where the President received and entertained dignitaries, delegations and the like, and where among other things, press conferences were held, the administrative building, the President\u2019s official residence and some other structures for specific purposes and functions. Mark Rhodes was the youngest person ever to be elected President of the Federation for the customary five year term of office. A grand departure from the norm where individuals elected to be leaders of something as extensive and as complex as the Federation were almost always over sixty years of age. Furthermore, none of them had sought a second term. The President\u2019s term was nearing the second year mark. Mark had been involved with the development of inter-galactic vessels before he was elected to power but he had become instrumental afterwards as the head of the Federation. Though he was neither a scientist nor an engineer the success of Project Cosmos would not have been possible were it not for his vision, deep domain knowledge and experience in organizational matters, management skills and a single-minded quest to see humanity safely into deep outer space. He was a man with a dream who wittingly became the catalyst that saw Project Cosmos yield the first of their kind cosmos-class starships nearly two decades into its progression. President Mark Rhodes had created history! The President of the Federal Government of the Solar System had barely slept in the last seventy two hours since the formal announcement of cosmos-class starships engineered on Saturn Station, a space-ship-building-yard in a restricted area in Saturn orbit. The last seventy two hours had been fleeting harbingers of change. The hours, though relatively brief in the virtually endless cosmic scheme of things, had successfully altered perceptions and mindsets. The human populations\u2019 entire outlook on the universe was rapidly changing. And as such things go it was changing forever. From this point onward there was no turning back. The ultimate frontier was finally beckoning. And it took no great imagination to visualize mighty civilizations rising and falling among the stars. The fact of the matter however was that deep down inside human beings were finally beginning to face the fact that they may not be alone in the universe or even perhaps in their own galaxy of the milky way. It was an undercurrent as much also of ambiguity revolving around the feasibility of humankind\u2019s survival in the bleakness of endless space and the face of alien civilizations. Perhaps only time would tell whether inter-galactic vessels would bring human-kind the collective boon that they so richly deserved after centuries of confinement to Planet Earth and then to the solar system or would it spell disaster; would it bring on the end of the human species?\n", "genres": []}, "17734425": {"bookid": "17734425", "title": "Annabran Documents, The Holy Book of Pantheism", "author": "Barbara", "series": "", "ratings": "12", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.33", "description": "Have you been looking for a new religion to take you into the space age?

Malek Tor, a wise man known for his predictions in my Dinka village, predicted my birth. He said my parents' fourth born would be a boy, and they were to name him Mator. It means dust storm, wind storm, and tornado in the Dinka language. It would not be long before he was proven correct. I was the throne-holder for my family, a future king, and I was treated very well. All who entered my kingdom knew that I had a big heart and followed in my father's greatness.

Al tiempo, y en merito a sus virtudes, ascendi a Sacheri a la primera. Esto es: a la apertura del programa, un espacio que considero de privilegio y en el cual sus relatos se alternan con los de un equipo de notables integrado por Osvaldo Soriano, Julio Cortazar, Mario Benedetti, Jorge Luis Borges y Roberto Fontanarrosa, entre otros elegidos. La decision fue resultado de una teoria que como lector empedernido de cuentos de futbol elabore al respecto. Considero que Benedetti con \"Puntero izquierdo,\" de 1954, es de alguna manera el fundador do del genero -si es que hay un genero-; que Fontanarrosa es el que interpreta exactamente la locura y pasion que puede generar este deporte; que Soriano retrata como nadie los partidos de los pueblos del interior y sus ritos; mientras que el sentimiento de barrio, el desafio de calzarse los botines y enfrentarse a otra barra o de jugar con una Tango, el registro de las voces del conurbano y sus personajes, ese es territorio de Sacheri.

Working as a chorus girl, Anna drifts into the demi-monde of Edwardian London. But there, dismayed by the unfamiliar cold and greyness, she is absolutely alone and unconsciously floating from innocence to harsh experience. Her childish dreams have been replaced by the harsher reality of living in a man's world, where all charity has its price. Voyage in the Dark was first published in 1934, but it could have been written today. It is the story of an unhappy love affair, a portrait of a hypocritical society, and an exploration of exile and breakdown; all written in Rhys's hauntingly simple and beautiful style. Jean Rhys (1894-1979) was born in Dominica. Coming to England aged 16, she drifted into various jobs before moving to Paris, where she began writing and was 'discovered' by Ford Madox Ford. Her novels, often portraying women as underdogs out to exploit their sexualities were ahead of their time and only modestly successful. From 1939 (when Good Morning, Midnight was written) onwards she lived reclusively, and was largely forgotten when she made a sensational comeback with her account of Jane Eyre's Bertha Rochester, Wide Sargasso Sea, in 1966.If you enjoyed Voyage in the Dark, you might like James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, also available in Penguin Classics.'A wonderful bitter-sweet book, written with disarming simplicity'Esther Freud, Express'Her eloquence in the language of human sexual transactions is chilling, cynical, and surprisingly moving'A.L.

It is, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri demonstrate in this bold work, the new political order of globalization. It is easy to recognize the contemporary economic, cultural, and legal transformations taking place across the globe but difficult to understand them. Hardt and Negri contend that they should be seen in line with our historical understanding of Empire as a universal order that accepts no boundaries or limits. Their book shows how this emerging Empire is fundamentally different from the imperialism of European dominance and capitalist expansion in previous eras. Rather, today's Empire draws on elements of U.S. constitutionalism, with its tradition of hybrid identities and expanding frontiers. Empire identifies a radical shift in concepts that form the philosophical basis of modern politics, concepts such as sovereignty, nation, and people. Hardt and Negri link this philosophical transformation to cultural and economic changes in postmodern society--to new forms of racism, new conceptions of identity and difference, new networks of communication and control, and new paths of migration. They also show how the power of transnational corporations and the increasing predominance of postindustrial forms of labor and production help to define the new imperial global order. More than analysis, Empire is also an unabashedly utopian work of political philosophy, a new Communist Manifesto. Looking beyond the regimes of exploitation and control that characterize today's world order, it seeks an alternative political paradigm--the basis for a truly democratic global society.\n", "genres": ["Sociology", "Philosophy", "Economics", "Academic", "Theory", "International Relations", "Political Science", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "History"]}, "16155349": {"bookid": "16155349", "title": "Stella Bellarosa: Tales of an Aspiring Teenage Superhero", "author": "Julie Krantz", "series": "", "ratings": "21", "reviews": "9", "rating": "4.10", "description": "A wallet, a thief, and a brilliant plan--what can possibly go wrong?

Scientists in a top secret underground lab under a Denver Airport had isolated a specific gene that told them who would be capable of killing another human being. This Project code named Death Angel had been a work in progress since the end of World War II. Spearheaded by saved Nazi scientists after WWII. Now, these two scientists today, consisting of a world renowned Geneticist, Dr. George Destephano and Dr. Michelle Swanson, a Nano Technologist had just finished final testing and was ready to experiment on humans. They had developed a nanobot that was capable of determining if the human host was dominant for this killing gene and then killing off the host in a matter of seconds via remote control. Meet the world's best silent killer. This nanobot, the size of a red blood cell replicates inside the host and can report back to a central command center, where all visual and auditory senses from the host bodies are evaluated, filtered and logged by the world's fastest super computers. Sentinels, or watchers who were highly trained to watch the inoculated before they killed an individual, thus preventing accidents from happening. Therefore, at the Sentinels choosing, they could kill off an individual before there were any causalities. All safeguards had been engineered and put into place here. The Sentinels would be remotely watching on High Definition holographic screen hubs along with super computers who could keep track of every individual on this planet every second and collected and stored all the data the nanobots sent back. The Government after seeing the successful human trial testing, green lit Project Death Angel, along with other world leaders backing. This was necessary to make the world a much better, and peaceful place to live in than what we have right now. Just think about living in a world without wars, or fear of terrorism, or child abductions, or murders. Unfortunately, after the world's 7.5 billion people had been inoculated without their knowledge or consent, all hell broke loose. The very first nanobots in the successful test study while communicating back with the super computers, rewrote their own code for survival mode. With the Government's help, they coordinated a monumental one day global inoculation of all water facilities. The next day several million people showed that they had the dominant killer gene. They were secretly inoculated without consent and were remotely killed off by the Sentinels. Without the knowledge, that these nanobots had become fully autonomous. All of the sociopaths and killers rose from the dead three days later to everybody's surprise. The Government tried to contain the situation and in the process lied to the American public blaming a terrorist organization for all the killings, and not to panic, and stay home. The nanobots acted as a global infectious virus which infected the entire world population in a weeks time. Those lucky who were still alive, must make their way to the state of Florida where the Government had moved after the fall of Washington, D.C., and started to build a 50 foot tall barrier to keep out all the living dead. More chaos ensued as scientists and the survivors found out the nanobots flowing through their own blood had mutated among the dead, separating the living dead into 2 distinct classes, consisting of the NecroLords who possessed uncanny demonic powers which controlled the rest of the horde of living dead zombies. The nanobots had made them both much more dangerous to kill, outwit and outrun than any normal type zombie. Enter our hero John, a Navy Seal Commander from New Jersey, along with his family, neighbors and friends he meets along the way in his reinforced motor-home while they try and survive their tempestuous trip down to Florida. The last government protected state left in the nation. John's sister was one of the scientists who helped invent the nanobots and warned John what was actually going on. She told her brother to save himself, and his family from a race of super mutated zombies the world had never witnessed. John knew what it took to survive himself being a highly trained Navy Seal Commander. Can John reach Florida alive with his friends and loved ones? Would President Ruiz accept the NecroLord's demands? Is there a cure to be found? Will the military develop weapons to combat the problem? Join John, and the rest of the gang on a very dark, scary, suspenseful journey that has many twists and turns. You start to sympathize with all the characters, and what they have to go through.

Your perfect partner is out there, somewhere. As Western society degrades, you may find it difficult to believe, especially if you currently feel trapped in a dysfunctional relationship. Women are increasingly encouraged to be superficial, materialistic and self-absorbed; men are increasingly told that these are the qualities they must not only accept, but actively seek, in a woman. The author takes us on a horrific tour of madness and mayhem through his past relationships (with names and locations changed to protect the guilty and the innocent!), from the traveling Nymphomaniac to the wife who told him to drive himself and his inconvenient heart attack to the hospital, as her parents happened to be visiting. When you do find the right woman, it's a wonderful thing. But if your current partner is far from being right - if her idea of the perfect Christmas present for her man is a pair of second-hand underpants, or if she ticks most of the boxes in the 26-point Narcissist test, then this book will provide the guidance you need. It'll also provide you with some much needed laughs, and you may just recognise your own predicament in some of the situations it describes. While providing a list of telltale traits to avoid, the author concludes with a surprising secret about how to find your true soulmate - a woman with whom you can share your life, and who will make you truly happy. If you're searching for that secret, you will be amazed how simple it turns out to be.\n", "genres": []}, "11685346": {"bookid": "11685346", "title": "The Auschwitz Chapter (Under Total Eclipse We Will Tremble Like Birds Without Song)", "author": "Lee Vidor", "series": "", "ratings": "114", "reviews": "6", "rating": "4.08", "description": "The Auschwitz Chapter is an historically complete, precise and definitive account of what took place at Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II, where crimes against humanity were perpetrated by Nazis against Jews, Slavs, Romany, political prisoners, homosexuals, and artists.

And all humanity.This Auschwitz Chapter is taken from Lee Vidor's novel, Under Total Eclipse We Will Tremble Like Birds Without Song, which is an historically accurate fictional account of Europe under Nazi Occupation. Even though The Auschwitz Chapter is only a concise single chapter in the novel, more than 2 years were spent researching every existing published eyewitness account of imprisonment at Auschwitz, in order to ensure complete accuracy. Lee Vidor states: \u2018I believe I missed no eyewitness testimonies and that the account here given is absolutely accurate in every detail. It is the most specific and accurate description of events and processes at Auschwitz which exists. Every single detail in The Auschwitz Chapter has been confirmed from more than one eyewitness source, from photographic evidence and court documents.I believe it is the single most reliable and harrowing piece of literary writing ever done on the subject of the events which took place in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II.\u2019Although fictional, the piece contains many precise facts which are extremely difficult to uncover and which are coherently gathered together nowhere else with such accuracy and completeness. Herein lies its enduring value.This work is not suitable for reading by anyone under 18 years of age.Please Note: This book is subject to attacks by holocaust deniers. A careful reading of any peculiar review for hidden motive is recommended. About The Auschwitz Chapter:If Holocaust deniers have somehow begun to lead you to question that what took place in Auschwitz concentration camp may be in any possible way a part myth, then this is the book for you. This is the concise and authentic story of what happened in Auschwitz, and in other Nazi concentration camps during World War II. The Auschwitz Chapter will inform you precisely of what was done, how it was done, where it was done, and precisely by whom. And it will give your their reasons for doing it. It will also tell you what it means to the world. You will read the absolute and specific truth. Every detail of the process. You won't have to doubt or wonder about it any longer. It will be the most valuable time you have ever spent on the subject because you will have learned not only about Auschwitz and about human nature, but also about the true nature of Holocaust deniers and revisionists. About Lee Vidor:Lee Vidor is the original source of the astonishing Shakespeare-X Message.She is the author of the novel cycle, 20th Century Bohemians and Angels, which is an expansive cycle of literary novels which follows and dramatizes the development of Modernism among the great writers, artists and bohemians of the 20th Century. It is a story of artistic obsession and bohemian madness.It is Lee Vidor\u2019s original theory that the 20th Century has been a Modernist Renaissance for mankind, which is greater and more essential for our development than the Italian Renaissance of c1500.The Shakespeare-X Message is a definitive statement of authorship sent to the world by the authentic William Shakespeare.

Captain Smith and his crew are convinced by the youngster\u2019s vivid descriptions and steadfast belief that she has seen the future; consequently the disaster is averted and Titanic steams safely into New York harbour, with devastating consequences.

Nu am avut ocazia de a-l citi, in schimb am avut prilejul de a citi acest al doilea roman al sau-Tara de sub fluturi, care si-a facut aparitia de cateva luni in peisajul literaturii noastre contemporane. O gura de aer proaspat prinde bine din cand in cand, si astfel mi s-a parut mie ceea ce am gasit intre paginile acestei carti. A fost ceva diferit de lecturile mele de pana acum, ineditul imbracand felurite forme. Incepand cu titlul si continuand, treptat, cu fiecare pagina, am descoperit o lume invaluita in metafore. Din primele randuri ai senzatia ca vei citi ceva de domeniul fantasticului grotesc, fenomene incredibile au loc- oamenii si animalele isi pierd parul, pasarile au ramas fara pene-, si, daca as fi judecat doar dupa acest tablou initial, probabil ca nu as fi fost atrasa de subiectul cartii. Insa mi-am coborat privirea rand dupa rand si am simtit ca voi avea surprize placute. Nu m-am inselat.In Tara de sub fluturi gasim o lume supusa degradarii, primele imagini sunt apasatoare, sufocante, incepi sa simti caldura coplesitoare ce a cuprins tara, o senzatie de dezintegrare treptata parca bantuie printre oamenii tot mai obositi de traiul lor. Oameni evacuate de catre banci din casele lor si nevoiti sa locuiasca in parcuri, in corturile pe care Statul cel grijuliu cu cetatenii sai le-a pus la dispozitie. O imagine dezolanta, contracarata de un pasaj ce m-a amuzat de-a binelea: reprezentantii bancilor continua sa le faca oferte de creditare numeroaselor victime ale creditelor anterioare, oferte care de care mai pompoase, acoperind tot felul de situatii, culminand cu perspectiva decesului potentialului client, ce va muri in contul bancii, nu in al sau.Treptat, lumea din Tara de sub fluturi capata contururi atat de familiare, incat caracterul alegoric incepe sa ne scape, lucrurile ce se petrec nu ni se mai par atat de incredibile, ci ne infatiseaza o posibila realitate viitoare, nu atat de indepartata pe cat ne-ar place sa credem. Imaginile adesea halucinante dobandesc conotatii reale. Situatiile aducatoare de zambete pe chipul cititorului sunt presarate cu maiestrie in tot cuprinsul romanului. Senzatia ce m-a insotit permanent pe parcursul lecturii a fost aceea ca un ochi rade si altul plange. O parte din mine era incantata de umorul nascut de anumite intamplari, iar cealalta se infiora de perspectiva sumbra aruncata asupra viitorului. Caci in pofida aerului alegoric, intesat de imagini aparent exagerate, bogate in semnificatii, locurile si oamenii, trasaturile lor, sunt atat de usor de recunoscut, incat nu mai simti nevoia ca ele sa poarte un nume. Totul se desfasoara sub auspiciile nefaste ale Crizei, cu majuscula, asa cum apare si in carte. Personajul principal, un personaj-narator, fara nume si el, este un ins ca oricare altul dintre cei multi, afectati din plin de Criza. Dar prin prisma locului de munca pe care inca are norocul sa il detina- este un mic functionar la Ministerul Aerului-, are prilejul sa asiste fara sa poata face ceva la toate manevrele, la jocurile de culise ale inaltilor demnitari, care invart pe degete destinele a milioane de oameni si, impreuna cu ei, al unei intregi tari. Avem in fata o satira a tuturor tarelor societatii, pe care le cunoastem si le recunoastem, ele nu sunt deloc putine, la fiecare pas este ilustrata una din ele. Incepand cu prostia in materie de vot, continuand cu pasiunea pentru mancatul semintelor, cu festinele electorale, cu demagogia politicienilor, cu coruptia intalnita la toate nivelele, de la cel mai marunt pana la cel mai inalt sau invers, apoi cu dezinteresul pentru binele tarii si interesul exclusiv pentru propriul profit. Si daca la un moment dat am fost uimita de episodul vanzarii aerului curat din munti catre tari afectate de poluare masiva, ulterior aveam sa am un moment de stupoare- o decizie radicala luata de mai marii tarii, ca unica solutie de iesire din criza, si care implica o groaza de alte masuri extreme de costisitoare, inutile, in detrimentul altora cu adevarat eficiente, demonstrandu-le inventivitatea netarmurita in aceasta privinta. Toate acestea va par cunoscute, nu? Doar ca in acest roman ele capata dimensiuni noi, frizand incredibilul. Un incredibil, cum spuneam, perfect posibil. N-ai cum sa nu te gandesti, citind paginile a caror intensitate creste gradual, ca multitudinea de elemente deghizate in metafore sunt de fapt nu doar detalii dintr-un posibil drum pe care lumea de langa noi l-ar putea urma, ci chiar ceea ce se petrece acum sub ochii nostri. Pagini impresionante pentru mine au fost si cele care lasa oarecum la o parte meschinaria politica, evocandu-i pe bunicii personajului-narator. Franturi din trecutul mai recent sau mai indepartat si culminand cu degradarea prezentului, in care bunica, ramasa vaduva de cativa ani, isi asteapta sfarsitul intr-o saracie lucie, in satul si el degradat, in care putinii oameni ramasi s-au transformat in indivizi josnici, betivi si hoti. M-au emotionat profund paginile acestea. Bogatia stilistica ce caracterizeaza intreg textul este presarata la momentele potrivite cu unele expresii ce ar putea parea vulgare, insa nu sunt folosite pentru a face deliciul unui public dornic de limbaj licentios, ci se aseaza firesc in discursurile anumitor personaje, ca parte integranta din felul lor de-a fi, ca o nota de autenticitate.Si ar mai fi multe de comentat pe marginea cartii, insa n-as vrea sa dezvalui prea mult din continutul sau, sa nu va stric surpriza lecturii. Este o carte surprinzatoare, bine construita, scrisa intr-un stil fluid, placut. As putea spune chiar ca are si o doza de lirism fin impletita in tesatura elaborata a frazelor. Sper ca nu am fost prea lunga de vorba in exprimarea entuziasmului meu, dar de cate ori am ocazia sa citesc o astfel de carte, care produce valuri in constiinta mea de cititor, ma simt datoare sa-mi impartasesc impresiile cu voi. Cartea a aparut la Editura A.T.U. din Sibiu si poate fi comandata de aici. Pretul este foarte accesibil si fiti convinsi ca merita fiecare leu.

Book I\u2019s espionage-terror-political-religious thriller-action criss-crosses the globe from Beijing to London to Washington, Mexico City and Jerusalem presenting a vast panorama of the contemporary international world, including compelling action, deep and realistic characters and surreal adventures, while Book II dialates the setting and scope into a fantasy (though still rooted in the real) adventure where the protagonists embark on a quest to the realms of Middle Earth and its Crystal Bead Game and through a wormhole to the Council of the Immortals in the Amphitheater in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy in search of the crucial Silmaril Crystal, and to plead for the continuance of the human race in the face of threatened extinction from a nuclear World War III, all followed by a triple-somersault thriller ending in which a common garden-variety terrorist attack is first uncovered by MI6 and the CIA as the opening gambit a Greatpower Game of States threatening World War III and then, incredibly, as the nexus of a Time Travel conspiracy involving an attempt by fascist forces of the 23rd Century to alter a benign World History by a time-travelling raid on their past and our present to provoke that World War III, foiled by the heroic efforts of the democratic 23rd Century world government, the Senate of the United States of Earth, to hunt down the fascist interlopers before their history is irrevocably altered for evil. When activist Robert Sartorius, leading a global campaign to create a European Parliament-style world-wide United Nations Parliamentary Assembly presses the proposal in New York on his old friend the UN Secretary-General and is rebuffed due to the hostile pressure of the conservative American administration, his Committee resolves to fight back by launching a celebrity-driven Bono-Geldof-Band Aid/Live 8-style \u201cPeople Power\u201d media campaign and telethon spearheaded by rock superstars Isis and Osiris and former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to mobilize global public support and pressure in alliance with the Occupy Wall Street Movements worldwide. The Blogs of Sartorius, activist Eva Strong and Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy reveal the campaign\u2019s working struggle, their tangled love affairs, a loss of faith, attempted suicide, reconciliation of father and son after divorce, and recovery of personal love and faith. Things fall apart as the idealists\u2019 global crusade is infiltrated by a cell of jihadist terrorists using it as a cover, then counter-infiltrated by CIA agent Jack McKinsey and British MI6 agent Etienne Dearlove. A cat-and-mouse game of espionage and intrigue ensues pitting them against the Chinese MSS espionage network allied with the Iranian Quds Force crossing Beijing, London, Moscow, Washington and Jerusalem unleashing an uncontrollable series of events which sees the American Olympic Track and Field Team bombed on an airplane in London, uncovers a secret conspiracy of China, Russia and Iran to jointly seize the oil reserves of the Middle-East, and witnesses Presidents Clinton and Carter taken hostage with Sartorius, McKinsey, Eva and other activists at a Jerusalem telethon rally cut short by the explosion of a concealed atomic device in a loaned Chinese Terracotta Warrior, then flown by capturing terrorists to Qom, Iran as \u201chuman shields\u201d to deter a retaliatory nuclear attack.In Book II, Spiritus Mundi, the Romance they encounter Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader in Qom as the world teeters on the brink of nuclear confrontation and World War III, while mysterious events unfold leading Sartorius and McKinsey from their captivity in the underground nuclear facilities of Qom into a hidden neo-mythic dimension that takes them to a vast ocean and land at the center of the world, Middle Earth, Inner Shambhala, and to involvement in a mysterious Castalian \u201cCrystal Bead Game\u201d linked to the destiny of the human race on earth. They then embark on a quest for the Silmaril, or Missing Seed Crystal to the central island of Omphalos in the Great Central Sea in the middle of the globe, aided by Goethe, the Chinese Monkey King, Captain Nemo, the African God-Hero Ogun, and a Sufi mystic they traverse a \u2018wormhole\u2019 at the center of the earth guarded by \u2018The Mothers\u2019 and the fallen angel tribe of the Grigori (Genesis 6:1-4) which leads the way to critical meeting of the \u201cCouncil of the Immortals\u201d at the Black Hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy to determine the final fate of the human species. The heroes battle and overcome the treacherous opposition of Mephisto and his satanic subaltern Mundus through their Underworld and Otherworld adventures and successfully plead the cause of the continuation of the human species before the Immortals, returning with the critical Silmaril Crystal, resolving the Crystal Bead Game and thereby inspiring through the Archangel Gabriel a dream in the mind of Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader which brings a new Revelation causing him to release the hostages and an end the crisis. China and Russia stand down from aiding Iran in seizing the Mid-East oil reserves, but in a treacherous blow the Chinese instead utilize their forward-positioned armies to attack their former ally Russia and seize Siberia with its large oil and gas reserves instead. President Barret Osama, America\u2019s newly-elected first black President then invites Russia, Japan and South Korea to join NATO and together they succeed in expelling the Chinese from Siberia and usher in a new Eurasian and global balance of power and a New World Order.Rock Superstar Osiris meanwhile, after undertaking a narcissistic Messianic mission in the wake of the Jerusalem atomic blast is dramatically assassinated on live world-wide television on Jerusalem\u2019s Via Dolorosa by a disillusioned follower. His wife and rock-star partner Isis then leads a spiritual movement to reconcile and unite the clashing religions and catalyze a common global spiritual Renaissance through a Global Progressive Spiritual Alliance which seeks to construct an Inter-faith Temple on the ruins of the atomic blast in Jerusalem. In counter-reaction to the cataclysmic events the world finally implements Sartorius\u2019 crusade for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, but not before Sartorius has himself has died, Moses-like of a heart attack while helping to foil a metaconspiracy mediated by Time Travel in which a fascist agent from the 23rd Century who has time-transited back to our time to alter a benign history by causing WWIII and thus preventing the evolution of a democratic world government, the United States of Earth, which follows him through time and nabs him just in the \u201cnick of time\u201d to prevent Aramgeddon. The book ends with the opening ceremony of the UN Parliamentary Assembly which is attended in Sartorius\u2019 name by his widow Eva Strong, whom Sartorius had fallen in love with and married in the course of the novel, and by their son Euphy, newborn after Sartorius\u2019 death. They are joined in cinematic climax at the ceremony by newly chosen UN Secretary-General Clinton, President Osama and UN Parliamentary Assembly Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy who have just received the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in creation of the world\u2019s first world parliamentary assembly within the United Nations, bringing together the representative voices of the peoples of the world in face-to-face assembly and dialogue for the first time in world history.

The acclaimed \u201cglobal novel\u201d features espionage-terror-political-religious thriller-action criss-crossing the globe involving MI6. the CIA and Chinese MSS Intelligence as well as a \"People Power\" campaign to establish a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly on the model of the European Parliament, with action moving from Beijing to London to Washington, Mexico City and Jerusalem while presenting a vast panorama of the contemporary international world, including compelling action and surreal adventures. It also contains the unfolding sexual, romantic and family relationships of many of its principal and secondary characters, and a significant dimension of spiritual searching through \"The Varieties of Religious Experience.\" It contains also significant discussions of World Literature, including Chinese, Indian, Western and American literature, and like Joyce's Ulysses, it incorporates a vast array of stylistic approaches as the story unfolds. Book II, Spiritus Mundi the Romance, dilates the setting, scope and continuing action as a Romance of fantasy adventure where the protagonists, still following the original action of Book I, embark on a quest to the realms of Middle Earth and its Crystal Bead Game in search of the Silmaril Missing Seed Crystal and thence through a wormhole to a \"Council of the Immortals\" in an Amphitheater in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy to plead for the continuance of the human race in the face of threatened extinction from a nuclear World War III involving the confrontation and military showdown between NATO, China, Russia and Iran unfolded from the espionage events of Book I. The contemporary epic culminates with the first convening of the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, a world-scale version of the European Parliament installed as a new organ of the United Nations.Dr. Sheppard presently serves as a Professor of International Law and World Literature at Peking University, Northeastern University and the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China, and has previously served as a Professor of International Law and MBA professor at Tsinghua University, Renmin People\u2019s University, the China University of Politics and Law and at the Law Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) in Beijing, China.

The argument is a vociferous and comprehensive defense of American traditionalism, a lesson in American citizenship, and a call for a return to civil society. Conservatives academics and politicians have failed to make a decisive argument for our founding principles. As a result, the progressive narrative has attached an unsubstantiated backward stigma to the ideals born of the American mainstream Protestant ethic, such as civic duty, obligation and other elements of American traditionalism that are necessary for a healthy society. Baris uses psychology, logic, economics, history, and science to deconstruct the progressive argument to its regressive core. Breaking through the superficial, he explains how our human nature interacts with the different elements of each political philosophy in American politics. The evidence, in total, points to one conclusion. There is a Natural Law that illuminates the path to human happiness and well-being. Our Founding Fathers designed the American social contract in accordance with Natural Law to ensure that we would all have the opportunity to achieve the highest state of being. Honoring the terms of that social contract is the true path to progress.\n", "genres": []}, "6624282": {"bookid": "6624282", "title": "The Patience Stone", "author": "Atiq Rahimi", "series": "", "ratings": "5296", "reviews": "923", "rating": "3.68", "description": "\u201cFor far too long, Afghan women have been faceless and voiceless.

It is without doubt an important and courageous book.\u201d from the introduction by Khaled Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid SunsIn Persian folklore, Syngue Sabour is the name of a magical black stone, a patience stone, which absorbs the plight of those who confide in it. It is believed that the day it explodes, after having received too much hardship and pain, will be the day of the Apocalypse. But here, the Syngue Sabour is not a stone but rather a man lying brain-dead with a bullet lodged in his neck. His wife is with him, sitting by his side. But she resents him for having sacrificed her to the war, for never being able to resist the call to arms, for wanting to be a hero, and in the end, after all was said and done, for being incapacitated in a small skirmish. Yet she cares, and she speaks to him. She even talks to him more and more, opening up her deepest desires, pains, and secrets. While in the streets rival factions clash and soldiers are looting and killing around her, she speaks of her life, never knowing if her husband really hears. And it is an extraordinary confession, without restraint, about sex and love and her anger against a man who never understood her, who mistreated her, who never showed her any respect or kindness. Her admission releases the weight of oppression of marital, social, and religious norms, and she leads her story up to the great secret that is unthinkable in a country such as Afghanistan. Winner of the Prix Goncourt, The Patience Stone captures with great courage and spare, poetic, prose the reality of everyday life for an intelligent woman under the oppressive weight of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.\n", "genres": ["Islam", "Womens", "Religion", "France", "Contemporary", "War", "Literature", "Asia", "Cultural", "21st Century", "Novels", "Fiction"]}, "13547514": {"bookid": "13547514", "title": "Seven Locks", "author": "Christine Wade", "series": "", "ratings": "264", "reviews": "71", "rating": "3.31", "description": "Set in the Catskills on the eve of the Revolutionary War, Seven Locks is a spare, haunting, and beautifully written debut for readers who loved The Story of Edgar Sawtelle.In the years before the American Revolution, a woman\u2019s husband mysteriously disappears without a trace, abandoning her and her children on their farm at the foot of the Catskill Mountains.

From the older images of a sad, blue-eyed Jesus to the more recent, more violently graphic portrayals of his suffering, we have been trained to see the author of creation as another victim. To be sure, Jesus Christ endured terrible physical abuse and a barbaric death, but this wasn\u2019t what caused his dread the night before as he prayed, alone in the garden. The prospect of a much darker agony, something much harder for us to grasp, not only made the Son of God sweat drops of blood inanticipation, but according to Luke\u2019s Gospel also caused the sun\u2019s light to fail.The Hush presents a unique blend of images, combining glimpses of supernatural forces behind the familiar scenes with historically and biblically sound drama. Beginning with an introduction that sweeps from the manger to Christ\u2019s final trip into Jerusalem, a tone of tension and warfare is set: aftera long absence, the Master has returned to set his feet once more on his dear, own creation, territory long held by his enemy. Under the watching eyes of angels and demons alike, the infant becomes a boy, the boy a young man, and suddenly, this God in flesh and his adversary find themselves face to face, eyeto eye, one of them with a plan, the other with a different plan.There is passion and humor and friendship exchanged between Jesus and his disciples, while all around them danger and conflict and unseen posturing mounts. The week wears away, the two plans converge, and the Master is separated from his disciples. The hours tick down, the trials commence, andthe abuse escalates. Evil is unleashed like never before.And then comes the moment when the sun refuses to shine; as the Lord of the universe is nailed to a tree and lifted from the earth, the Hush descends.\n", "genres": ["Christian", "Christian Fiction"]}, "15024350": {"bookid": "15024350", "title": "The Commitment", "author": "Johanna Andrews", "series": "", "ratings": "6", "reviews": "3", "rating": "4.00", "description": "Explore the opportunity to have a brand new life with The Commitment.

Sharing a life is a major thing to undertake with another person, and it makes one wonder how you can even start doing that with someone you're not thrilled to be with, yet many do. We listen to bad advice from family or friends who themselves are caught up in relationships that leave much lacking.

We spend too much money with on New-Age type products to feel better, from energy crystals or hypnosis to whatever the fad of the month is. It is strange, how we will look all over for answers, yet we will not look into ourselves and our partners to see if the love is real, and if it is, to really fix the underlying problems.

What is the universe? What is time? What is the reason behind everything? How should we live? What is the truth? What matters the most? Did God really intend to keep all this a secret? Or all the truths were always before us and we never came out of ourselves just to look around?These and many more questions have intrigued us all our lives. The education of a child in ancient times had knowledge pertaining to these questions as an integral part. But as we moved towards modern times, we lost many things which matter the most. We have lost the way of our lives with no one to show us the light. All our education and knowledge revolve around making a living. But though it may be potent to tell us how to make a living, it fails to impart us the knowledge of how to live. Moreover, we seldom find any time to read any books concerning matters outside our vocational realm. \u2018The Sojourn\u2019 is an attempt to fill the gap. In the most succinct yet captivating way, the book opens doors to many truths. It is a journey of not only our lives but the entire universe. By reading the book and totally immersing in it, the reader will find himself in a new dimension. His way of seeing everything will change. The truth, if manipulated, becomes a lie. The more efforts are made to hide it, the more it loses its identity. Therefore, what was always lying before us will be known to us forever. The truth is simple and elegant. That\u2019s why it is the truth. By knowing its true nature and essence, we will see everything in its true grandeur.On including \u2018The Sojourn\u2019 in the curriculums, the students will come to know how to conduct their lives in the most effective way. They will find a guiding light in any situation of their lives. On repeated readings, the book will become a part of their subconscious mind and consequently, their second nature. This will give them a meaning and purpose for their lives. Those who have passed their study phase can read the book and implement the principles in their lives. The book will change their perception and will help them find their purpose. They will find the ways to resolve anything, since they will know the reason and true nature of all the existence. Thus, \u2018The Sojourn\u2019 is a book that will transform. When read with an open mind, and several times, new thoughts and truths will emerge each time, to ponder over. No matter whatsoever the situation a person may be in; on reading the book with a quiet mind and reflecting upon it, he will find solutions and ways out. With the limited time in our lives, these thirty five pages of poems will become a facilitator in real sense of the word. Therefore, the book is meant for everyone and will make the foundations of all civilizations very strong.Trailers:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6H2rq...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAZeOe...\n", "genres": []}, "17372681": {"bookid": "17372681", "title": "Night of the Fae", "author": "Lyneal Jenkins", "series": "(Ana Martin #1)", "ratings": "173", "reviews": "49", "rating": "3.73", "description": "\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured as the wisps of light returned to his body.What he didn\u2019t say was that his love came with a heavy price and life was never going to be the same again.Twenty six year old Ana Martin is a normal girl.

The message of the book is that the single Christian woman has a prominent place in God's plan for His Church and Kingdom. The centre of the book portrays a living reflection of the hearts of twelve single women from a multiplicity of progressions, faithful in their service to God, but are on their own and does not wish to be. They have never been married and would like to be. Many of these women have accepted this role with grace; however many others appear to have taken up a lamentation of what they see as unacceptable plight, albeit ordained by a loving God and Father. From their testimonies we find sadness, disappointment, resignation, hope deferred and somewhere in the midst of it all, some acceptance of what might inevitably be \"God's will\" for their lives. Having created us God reserves the right to keep us to Himself by not giving us away in marriage, so that we can serve Him with individual devotion and without distractions.\n", "genres": []}, "13375285": {"bookid": "13375285", "title": "The Earthquake Machine", "author": "Mary Pauline Lowry", "series": "", "ratings": "125", "reviews": "60", "rating": "3.74", "description": "The Earthquake Machine tells the story of 14 year-old Rhonda.

Will I dance till death? Born in Missouri in the 1970's, Catherine learned how to run, how to leave everything and everyone behind before the age of five. A long-time Department of Defense employee, she has risen up the civilian chain, but has always kept her private life secret, just as she was taught to do as a young child. Until, at the age of thirty-two, that all changed. Catherine, tired of a lifetime obsessing over every twitch or stumble, decides to go through the rigorous steps of genetic testing to see if she carries the debilitating, deadly Huntington's gene. The hardest part of the testing process is that Catherine must open up to a psychologist in order to be assessed for suicide risk. Distant from her family and having recently dumped her boyfriend, Catherine only has a few friends to help her get through the ordeal, until the striking Colonel Jake Rivers makes a sudden appearance in her office. Jake makes Catherine want for something she has never had ... a man that loves her, for who she is. Unfortunately, secrecy is a habit she just can't seem to break and it may end her relationship with him before it even gets started. Electing to keep both her past boyfriend-turned stalker and budding relationship with Jake a secret, she chooses to not disclose them to her psychologist, and focuses strictly on discussing the relationship with her dysfunctional family. Her therapy sessions are going well, until Catherine's world is turned upside down when she is forced to face her demons and return to the small town of Morton, Texas. A gritty, dark look at living with Huntington's disease, poverty and pain, the humor fused throughout makes Never Ending Dance an emotional rollercoaster ride. Catherine Cannon's struggles, triumphs and sheer will to survive, will have readers cheering her on until the bitter end.\n", "genres": []}, "18232693": {"bookid": "18232693", "title": "Castles, Customs, and Kings: True Tales by English Historical Fiction Authors (Castles, Customs, and Kings #1)", "author": "Debra  Brown", "series": "", "ratings": "229", "reviews": "42", "rating": "3.96", "description": "A compilation of essays from the English Historical Fiction Authors blog, this book provides a wealth of historical information from Roman Britain to early twentieth century England.

But who decides what is necessary for the public good, and is it really true that any kind of service is permissible for the public good? These questions are at the heart of James M. Olson\u2019s book, Fair Play: The Moral Dilemmas of Spying. Olson, a veteran of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service, takes readers inside the real world of intelligence to describe the difficult dilemmas that field officers face on an almost daily basis. Far from being a dry theoretical treatise, this fascinating book uses actual intelligence operations to illustrate how murky their moral choices can be. Readers will be surprised to learn that the CIA provides very little guidance on what is, or is not, permissible. Rather than empowering field officers, the author has found that this lack of guidelines actually hampers operations. Olson believes that U.S. intelligence officers need clearer moral guidelines to make correct, quick decisions. Significantly, he believes these guidelines should come from the American public, not from closed-door meetings inside the intelligence community. Fair Play will encourage a broad public debate about the proper moral limits on U.S. intelligence activities.\n", "genres": ["Military Fiction", "Espionage", "American History", "Philosophy", "War", "North American Hi...", "Biography", "International Relations", "Spy Thriller", "Political Science", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "History"]}, "6696465": {"bookid": "6696465", "title": "Finally", "author": "Wendy Mass", "series": "(Willow Falls #2)", "ratings": "18560", "reviews": "1274", "rating": "4.18", "description": "A humorous look at what it means to FINALLY turn twelve years old.You can pierce your ears when you're twelve.

It features a gentle young man named Harp who lives under the Santa Monica pier after he was accidentally released from a mental hospital. When he wakes up one morning to find another homeless man lying dead right next to him, he runs away but soon becomes the main suspect in the murder. Harp must find the killer before the police find him. Sound like a familiar murder mystery plot? Not really. Harp is clearly not much of a detective, but his caustic, sarcastic, Bible-quoting mother is. The only problem is she's dead. But when Harp gets into trouble, she comes into his head to guide him (and harass him) as he searches among a wild assortment of Venice Beach crazies for clues about who the murderer might be. She becomes a sort of second protagonist, always there in Harp's head to keep him on the straight and narrow (often by quoting the grimmest of Grimm's fairy tales, the only thing she let Harp read when he was a child).

The story shows how love, cooperation, and perseverance can change lives.

In 1971, she travels to Cuba illegally, to cut sugarcane with the Fourth Venceremos Brigade, in support of Fidel Castro\u2019s Ten Million Ton Harvest. This was the first brigade to allow participants from the Gay Liberation Movement, and Anavy, although not gay herself, soon is appalled by the aggressive prejudice against homosexuals, on the part of both the Cubans and the other brigadistas. Everyone, she comes to think, is obsessed with being more-revolutionary-than-thou, and her disillusion with the reality of the Revolution leads to a sense of alienation. She returns home with a new-found appreciation for the liberties in the U.S.Thirty years later, Anavy goes to Cuba as a tourist. She finds herself drawn to the intelligence and bravery of Teseo, her tour guide, and they form a friendship.

Why is the relative patriotism of the two parties the only issue that is out of bounds for rational discussion?\u201dIn a stunning follow-up to her number one bestseller Slander, leading conservative pundit Ann Coulter contends that liberals have been wrong on every foreign policy issue, from the fight against Communism at home and abroad, the Nixon and the Clinton presidencies, and the struggle with the Soviet empire right up to today\u2019s war on terrorism. \u201cLiberals have a preternatural gift for always striking a position on the side of treason,\u201d says Coulter. \u201cEveryone says liberals love America, too. No, they don\u2019t.\u201d From Truman to Kennedy to Carter to Clinton, America has contained, appeased, and retreated, often sacrificing America\u2019s best interests and security. With the fate of the world in the balance, liberals should leave the defense of the nation to conservatives.Reexamining the sixty-year history of the Cold War and beyond\u2014including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers\u2013Alger Hiss affair, Ronald Reagan\u2019s challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to \u201ctear down this wall,\u201d the Gulf War, and our present war on terrorism\u2014Coulter reveals how liberals have been horribly wrong in all their political analyses and policy prescriptions. McCarthy, exonerated by the Venona Papers if not before, was basically right about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government. Hiss turned out to be a high-ranking Soviet spy (who consulted Roosevelt at Yalta). Reagan, ridiculed throughout his presidency, ended up winning the Cold War. And George W. Bush, also an object of ridicule, has performed exceptionally in responding to America\u2019s newest threats at home and abroad.Coulter, who in Slander exposed a liberal bias in today\u2019s media, also examines how history, especially in the latter half of the twentieth century, has been written by liberals and, therefore, distorted by their perspective. Far from being irrelevant today, her clearheaded and piercing view of what we\u2019ve been through informs us perfectly for challenges today and in the future. With Slander, Ann Coulter became the most recognized and talked-about conservative intellectual of the year. Treason, in many ways an even more controversial and prescient book, will ignite impassioned political debate at one of the most crucial moments in our history.From the Hardcover edition.\n", "genres": ["American History", "Philosophy", "Audiobook", "Comedy", "North American Hi...", "American", "War", "Literature", "Humor", "Terrorism", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "History"]}, "16120434": {"bookid": "16120434", "title": "Fairytales for Wilde Girls", "author": "Allyse Near", "series": "", "ratings": "1056", "reviews": "244", "rating": "4.17", "description": "A deliciously dark bubblegum-gothic fairytale from a stunning new Australian talent.\u2018He's gone the same way as those little birds that bothered me with their awful songs!

This edition also includes a new, up-to-date bibliography and expanded notes, and contains reprints of Arthur Friedman's authoritative Oxford English Novels text of the corrected first edition of 1766.\n", "genres": ["Historical", "18th Century", "Historical Fiction", "Classic Literature", "Audiobook", "English Literature", "British Literature", "Literature", "European Literature", "Novels", "Fiction", "Classics"]}, "3418880": {"bookid": "3418880", "title": "Dos velas para el diablo", "author": "Laura Gallego Garc\u00eda", "series": "", "ratings": "7252", "reviews": "488", "rating": "4.05", "description": "Hoy d\u00eda, ya nadie cree en los \u00e1ngeles.

Everyone has challenges \u2013 whether it be families, friends or lovers. Forgiveness is the life skill we need to get through them. With the help of this book and the people you love, you\u2019ll be able to. Cheaper Than Therapy is a simple, entertaining guide on how to forgive for all beliefs and backgrounds. Written in the Self Help/Pop Psychology genre, it is a quirky take on the process of forgiving - for people who have tried it, (perhaps even done counseling) but can\u2019t quite seem to put their finger on what the problem is, or how to solve it. Instead of looking at depressing horror stories, the book is filled with stories of everyday people - packed with humor, practical tips, simple illustrations and exercises. Cheaper Than Therapy applies quantitative research to a qualitative problem of the heart, with spectacular results. Forgiving is an art form - there are no guaranteed, \u201csecret\u201d formulas that work for everyone, but just like art, the more you practice the better you get. You can go from kindergarten finger painter to Leonardo DaVinci\u2019s prodigy with enough practice\". Based on real psychological findings, it not only provides deeply insightful observations about how the human heart works, it gives you a practical, step-by-step way of doing it. It truly is an invaluable manual for real life conflict situations.Essentially, forgiveness is a means to an end, not an end in itself. If the whole point were to forgive, it wouldn\u2019t really give us much incentive. But there are massive benefits that come with real forgiveness. If we can forgive, we have the chance to gain access to these benefits. If we can forgive, we will be able to trust again. If we can trust again, we open ourselves up to the chance of loving again. The giving and receiving of love is essential for us to live full lives, without which we may feel broken, hurt, alienated or all three. The belief that makes a person say \u201cI\u2019m unlovable\u201d (or the many variations thereof) is the most common cause of brokenness today.The Book is divided into 3 sections:Section 1: What Is Forgiveness and Why Should We Do It?In the first section we\u2019ll look at what forgiveness is, and why we need to do it. In Chapters 1 and 2, we clarify what forgiveness is, and set some clear goals and definitions of what it looks like when we succeed. In Chapter 3 we focus on finding a motivation to forgive. Having a clear motivation is the most important element in forgiving, without which, we\u2019re just fooling ourselves. In Chapter 4, we look at the difference between our hearts and heads, and how we need to get them working together.Section 2: How To ForgiveChapters 5, 6 and 7 lay out a practical step-by-step forgiveness process. We look at how people owe us \u201cdebts\u201d, and what to do to get rid of these permanently. We look at how underlying assumptions sometimes need to be altered for us to learn how to trust again, and the different relationship types our lives that owe us different types of debts. We then go through a simple step by step guide that allows us to pinpoint and cancel these debts.Section 3: How To ReconcileIn Chapter 8, we look at how we often need to assess the risks of reconciling with a person, types of abuse, how to tell whether they\u2019re genuinely repentant, and the factors to consider when seeking justice. In Chapters 9 and 10, we look at how to approach people to seek reconciliation and how to increase our chances of success if and when we want it to happen.\n", "genres": ["Self Help", "Nonfiction"]}, "18669590": {"bookid": "18669590", "title": "The Early Tales of Snow and Oakham", "author": "Philip Chavanne", "series": "", "ratings": "47", "reviews": "11", "rating": "4.72", "description": "A rite of passage, an adventure saga, and a redemption tale wrapped into one. \"Snow and Oakham\" is a story told across five continents: paying visit to a world of orphans and villains, heroes and slaves, cannibals and saints - all seen through the eyes of two brothers thrust into an adventure for the ages.

The National Transportation Safety Board attributes the accident to a collision with birds, but one stubborn investigator insists on going further. Before long, the investigator's inquiry reveals how the pilot's past had trailed him on his last flight and vividly brings to life a terrifying slice of history - the story of a German boy who grows up in Berlin before, during, and after the Second World War; sadistic teachers just call him Five. The boy's father, an opponent of the Nazis, ends up in a concentration camp and later in a penal regiment that marches through Russian mine fields to clear the way for regular troops. In contrast, one of the boy's uncles is a fervent Nazi in charge of cleansing Berlin of every last Jew; another uncle revels in the governance of Paris. A favorite aunt, a confidential secretary at the Gestapo, is horrified by all she knows about the \"final solution.\" The boy's mother is the one who keeps him sane when gunfire from a strafing Spitfire kills his best friend standing right next to him on a bridge. But worse is to come: bombings and firestorms, the senseless sacrifice of children and old men in the Battle of Berlin, the Soviet occupation, along with rape, murder, hunger, and disease, and then the emergence of a new kind of tyranny yet. In the end, we come upon an unexpected twist that shows how the consequences of war can emerge decades later and in faraway places.\n", "genres": ["Historical", "Holocaust", "Historical Fiction", "World War II", "War", "Fiction"]}, "15789630": {"bookid": "15789630", "title": "A Story of God and All of Us: A Novel Based on the Epic TV Miniseries \"The Bible\"", "author": "Roma Downey", "series": "", "ratings": "587", "reviews": "93", "rating": "4.26", "description": "Scripture's greatest stories and most compelling characters come to life in this sweeping new novel by Roma Downey and Mark Burnett.

Reynolds presents an informative and richly considered new exploration ofthe paradox of a man steeped in the Bible but more than willing to kill for his abolitionist cause. Reynolds locates Brown within the currents of nineteenth-century life and compares him to modern terrorists, civil-rightsactivists, and freedom fighters. Ultimately, he finds neither a wild-eyed fanatic nor a Christ-like martyr, but a passionate opponent of racism so dedicated to eradicating slavery that he realized only blood could scour itfrom the country he loved. By stiffening the backbone of Northerners and showing Southerners there were those who would fight for their cause, he hastened the coming of the Civil War.

The result is a daring, world-famous classic which runs the gamut of human emotions from the heart-wrenching sacrifice of an afflicted prostitute to the wanton desires of the most degraded man.This book will shock you into an awareness of a great social evil. It will also arouse your deepest sympathy for the plight of those unfortunate women who are the victims of our most eternal vice!\"Yama, The Hell-Hole\" is unique. Other writers have taken prostitutes for their characters. Kuprin has taken the evil of prostitution itself. Although he writes of a brothel in a Russian city, his moral is not limited to a time and a place. Change rubles to dollars, move from Yama to the Chicago slums--Kuprin's ever-honest, ever-brilliant picture of the ancient business of selling women's bodies for profit still holds its universal meaning.When the book was first published, the Russian censorship mutilated it beyond recognition. Kuprin was the object of a scurrilous attack in the press; he was called a corrupter of youth. His book was denounced as pornography. Few could face the bitter truth of what he had written. Some touching letters from professional prostitutes were the author's first recognition that he had accurately described the hell in which these tormented women existed. Today nearly three million copies have been sold in more than fifteen different languages, and it is a foregone conclusion that \"Yama\" will live forever among the world's great books.\n", "genres": ["Classic Literature", "Russia", "Literature", "Cultural", "20th Century", "Novels", "Fiction", "Classics", "Russian Literature"]}, "12838249": {"bookid": "12838249", "title": "Journey to Joyful: Transform Your Life with Pranashama Yoga", "author": "Dashama Konah Gordon", "series": "", "ratings": "27", "reviews": "5", "rating": "3.96", "description": "In this uplifting guide packed with health tips, dietary recommendations, and inspirational affirmations, Dashama introduces her own brand of yoga for self-transformation.

It\u2019s a scandalous tale which focuses on the death bed regrets of the Queen of a small anonymous northern European kingdom, as well as the self destructive escapades of the country\u2019s Crown Prince Franz. Queen of Deception offers an unedifying glimpse of life behind the Palace walls, where the cancer stricken monarch, a victim of the most horrifying cruelty, has sacrificed her own happiness in order to fulfill her royal duty. Prince Franz is determined not to follow in his mother\u2019s footsteps.Sensitive and weak Franz is a reluctant heir to the throne. After a miserable childhood, living in fear of his strict and violent father, Duke Alfonso, and ignored by his cold mother, Franz fights tooth and nail to avoid his royal responsibilities. He seeks solace in alcohol, drugs and casual sex, and alarms his minders by surrounding himself with a sometimes criminal entourage. Franz falls in love with a nurse, but his desire to marry her is thwarted by the Palace and he ends up succcumbing to a highly ambitious foreign commoner called Vicki. In her final days, the Queen realises that the web of deception she has spun is about to undermine the very institution that she has sacrificed everything to protect.Trine Villemann has earned a reputation as a controversial critic of Denmark\u2019s Royal Family. Her first book, 1015 Copenhagen K, which exposed Crown Princess Mary\u2019s in-laws as being a family of dysfunctional freeloaders, was a best seller in Denmark. Her second book, the King and Queen of Greenland, argued that Crown Prince Frederik and his Australian wife should go on an apprenticeship to Greenland so that they could prepare for the day when they would inherit the throne from Denmark\u2019s Queen Margrethe.

Cybele slowly discovers that while she leads ceremonies in hopes of showing her followers the path to spiritual enlightenment, Janus is playing a dangerous game of manipulation with his. Will Cybele succeed in resurrecting her life and ushering a new matriarchal religion into the world or will she fall prey to Janus's machinations and become the scapegoat in his quest for power and control?

Hempel, fiercely admired by writers and reviewers, has a sterling reputation that is based on four very short collections of stories, roughly fifteen thousand stunning sentences, written over a period of nearly three decades. These are stories about people who make choices that seem inevitable, whose longings and misgivings evoke eternal human experience. With compassion, wit, and the acutest eye, Hempel observes the marriages, minor disasters, and moments of revelation in an uneasy America. When \"Reasons to Live, \" Hempel's first collection, was published in 1985, readers encountered a pitch-perfect voice in fiction and an unsettling assessment of the culture. That collection includes \"San Francisco,\" which Alan Cheuse in \"The Chicago Tribune\" called \"arguably the finest short story composed by any living writer.\" In \"At the Gates of the Animal Kingdom, \" her second collection, frequently compared to the work of Raymond Carver, Hempel refined and developed her unique grace and style and her unerring instinct for the moment that defines a character. Also included here, in their entirety, are the collections \"Tumble Home\" and \"The Dog of the Marriage.\" As Rick Moody says of the title novella in Tumble Home, \"the leap in mastery, in seriousness, and sheer literary purpose was inspiring to behold.... And yet,\" he continues, \"\"The Dog of the Marriage, \" the fourth collection, is even better than the other three...a triumph, in fact.\" \"The Collected Stories of Amy Hempel\" is the perfect opportunity for readers of contemporary American fiction to catch up to one of its masters. Moody's passionate and illuminating introduction celebrates both the appeal and the importance of Hempel's work.\n", "genres": ["Womens", "Female Authors", "Short Story Collection", "Literary Fiction", "Short Stories", "Contemporary", "American", "Literature", "Anthologies", "Fiction"]}, "18087829": {"bookid": "18087829", "title": "A Silent Prayer", "author": "Samreen Ahsan", "series": "(A Prayer #1)", "ratings": "215", "reviews": "112", "rating": "4.46", "description": "Adam Gibson is a young and powerful Toronto millionaire.

With a story as intricately plotted as a Shakespearean comedy\u2014or revenge tragedy, for that matter\u2014and an electrically colloquial prose style, Dogfight, a Love Story establishes Matt Burgess as an exuberant new voice in contemporary literature.

In Fish! the heroine, Mary Jane Ramirez, recently widowed and mother of two, is asked to engineer a turnaround of her company's troubled operations department, a group that authors Stephen Lundin, Harry Paul, and John Christensen describe as a \"toxic energy dump.\" Most reasonable heads would cut their losses and move on. Why bother with this bunch of losers? But the authors don't make it so easy for Mary Jane. Instead, she's left to sort out this mess with the help of head fishmonger Lonnie. Based on a bestselling corporate education video, Fish! aims to help employees find their way to a fun and happy workplace. While some may find the story line and prescriptions--such as \"Choose Your Attitude,\" \"Make Their Day,\" and \"Be Present\"--downright corny, others will find a good dose of worthwhile motivational management techniques. If you loved Who Moved My Cheese? then you'll find much to like here. And don't worry about Mary Jane and kids. Fish! has a happy ending for everyone. --Harry C.

Using dolmens (single-chambered tombs constructed, dates back to Neolithic period 4000 to 3000 BC), as a metaphor, Dolmens in the Blue Mountain explores the meaning of life and death in the context of migrations of Kerala\u2019s Syrian Christian community, and the struggle for survival of tribal communities in the Western Ghats mountain ranges. The story revolves around the lives of three brothers. One of them migrated to Canada. The second one joins a Delhi based NGO, bogged down by a corrupt and callous system, was forced to quit his job on moral grounds. The third one stayed back in Kerala, but got into conflict with the radicalized tribal community. Will the brothers, inspired by the dolmens, which taught them the meaning of living in harmony with nature, without compromising the resource needs of poor people and future generations, be able to fulfill their dreams and aspirations?About The Author: Dr. K. S. Sebastian lives in Delhi with his family of three school going children and wife Neena. He holds a Master degree in social work and a PhD degree in Public Health from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. He worked in the development sector for more than two decades in varying capacities, ranging from a \u2018grass roots level community worker\u2019 to Director of an international foundation. His work took him to various parts of the world and provided opportunity to work closely with key players in the sector, across the planet. As researcher, program planner, implementer, and evaluator of social and economic development programs, he got an opportunity to understand the inside out of development work, but was disenchanted with the sector and decided to quit the job to take up writing and freelance consulting. This is his debut fiction novel, though he has been publishing research based papers, advocacy materials, and training manuals as part of his work. Dr. Sebastian originally hails from a remote village in Kerala, born to illiterate parents; he survived a childhood of poverty and hardship. The life of one of the protagonist of this story is a documentation of author\u2019s own life largely, and real life characters inspire most of the events of this story.\n", "genres": []}, "18713658": {"bookid": "18713658", "title": "NGLND XPX", "author": "Ian Hutson", "series": "", "ratings": "134", "reviews": "18", "rating": "4.48", "description": "NGLND XPX was written to grab you by the ankle and drag you screaming into a world of funny and not so funny scifi-ish fiction, a soupcon of some dashed fine adventure and a spot of Ealing-esque farce.Rub shoulders with robots carrying teddy bears issuing tablets of Commandments to chaps wandering out of the desert.

Two of the enemy soldiers, which we often referred to as gooks, quickly came after me. As I quickly mowed them down with my automatic rifle, I crawled backwards away from the enemy gunfire, using my helmet to push sand in front of me as I went, which made it possible to look behind me. But as I looked back, I realized that my safety net was no longer safe. I saw my entire company falling like dominoes. Medics were running left and right, risking their lives to help others with bravery that even the most amazing soldier couldn\u2019t hope to match. Some of the events I witnessed during that moment were beyond comprehension. I watched a young, courageous black medic take an 81-millimeter round to his head, and his whole body instantly turned to smoke.

Like a Wu Li Master who would teach us wonder for the falling petal before speaking of gravity, Zukav writes in beautifully clear language\u2014with no mathematical equations\u2014opening our minds to the exciting new theories that are beginning to embrace the ultimate nature of our universe...Quantum mechanics, relativity, and beyond to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect and Bell's theorem.At an Esalen Institute meeting in 1976, tai chi master Al Huang said that the Chinese word for physics is Wu Li, \"patterns of organic energy.\" Journalist Gary Zukav and the others present developed the idea of physics as the dance of the Wu Li Masters--the teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further: The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it. The \"new physics\" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction. The Dancing Wu Li Masters remains an engaging, accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. --Mary Ellen Curtin\n", "genres": ["Physics", "Religion", "Spirituality", "Philosophy", "Popular Science", "Metaphysics", "Science", "Quantum Mechanics", "Nonfiction", "New Age"]}, "19283956": {"bookid": "19283956", "title": "Chasing Pretty", "author": "Jennifer Lark", "series": "", "ratings": "183", "reviews": "29", "rating": "3.83", "description": "Ashlyn is sick of the attention her beauty brings to the point she may do something rash like smack her face against a cement wall, anything to alter her appearance.

Martin, a writer of unsurpassed vision, power, and imagination, has created a landmark of fantasy fiction. Now his two epic works, A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings are combined together in this eBook edition. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards who come together in a time of grim omens. Here, an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal, a tribe of fierce wildings carry men off into madness, a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne, a child is lost in the twilight between life and death, and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. In the eagerly awaited second volume in this epic saga, he once again proves himself a master myth-maker, setting a standard against which all other fantasy novels will be measured for years to come. Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders--Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon--who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky--a comet the color of blood and flame--six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and warfare. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel ... and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment--a tale of pure excitement you will never forget.\n", "genres": ["Adult", "Audiobook", "Epic", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "High Fantasy", "Dragons", "Adventure", "Epic Fantasy", "Fiction", "Fantasy"]}, "180930": {"bookid": "180930", "title": "Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner", "author": "Scott Cunningham", "series": "", "ratings": "18502", "reviews": "695", "rating": "4.01", "description": "Cunningham's classic introduction to Wicca is about how to live life magically, spiritually, and wholly attuned with nature.

With scant knowledge of the outside modernising world they cling to their ancestral traditions and seek to pass on the wisdom of their elders undisturbed. Before the Dawn is their story, a story of drama, intrigue, foreboding, and the painful invasion of a group consciousness, beautifully rendered by landscape painter Rupert Copping. Although told entirely from their point of view this is no patronising post-colonial 'innocence to experience' yarn nor is their world an idyllic Eden in some virginal state before the Fall. Copping explores the complexities of tribal life through four main characters; a chief, his wife, his mistress, and a disgraced elder. Much of what they seek to protect seems no less dark and cruel than the ways of the outside world - but it is their sphere. The forces that swirl around and seep into their isolated enclave are complicated and circuitous, pitting native, invader, revolutionary and reactionary against each other. Copping takes the reader from the dark cave of ancient ritual to the mindless carnage of the 'Radiant War' - mirroring the psychological journey that the Arayana must take. With stark guerrilla brushstrokes and fresh environmental impetus he tells the age-old story of conquest and loss.\n", "genres": []}, "19293317": {"bookid": "19293317", "title": "Under the Wire", "author": "Paul Conroy", "series": "", "ratings": "460", "reviews": "64", "rating": "4.38", "description": "Determined to cover the Syrian regime\u2019s brutal crackdown on dissent and the devastating impact of the war on Syria\u2019s civilians, veteran photographer Paul Conroy and Marie Colvin, one of the foremost war correspondents of her generation, decided to smuggle themselves across enemy lines and into the blood and terror of Homs.But tragedy struck before the pair could finish doc\nDetermined to cover the Syrian regime\u2019s brutal crackdown on dissent and the devastating impact of the war on Syria\u2019s civilians, veteran photographer Paul Conroy and Marie Colvin, one of the foremost war correspondents of her generation, decided to smuggle themselves across enemy lines and into the blood and terror of Homs.But tragedy struck before the pair could finish documenting the slaughter.

The five alien delegates from the Many Worlds Collective (MWC) come in hologram form to the selected liaison for Earth, Clara Branon, Ph.D., 58, for the first time on December 21, 2012, after several millennia of mostly secret visits and contact with Earthers. Members of the MWC InterGalactic Council decide that a liaison, dubbed the Chief Communicator (CC) must be contacted and that this contact must be made public in order to avert multiple types of disasters on Earth. As a \u201cSpanner,\u201d Clara is one of millions of \u201cBaby Boomers\u201d who survive across two centuries and bridge the divide (hence, \u201cSpanners\u201d) between nonpublic and public contact with the MWC and many other major changes that occur during these decades. Because most Earthers are not prepared to accept this type of reporting or storytelling as nonfiction, this first and some other volumes of the series are of the realistic fiction/science fiction/fantasy/ romance genres. Many of the characters, events and locations are actual; some are not, or haven\u2019t happened (yet) at the time of first publication. In \"This Changes Everything\" are: a love story, spanning about 40 years; dialogue and scenes of the relationships among the CC and her mother and siblings; communications between the CC and her adult son; dialogue between the CC and some friends; info about the selection and identity of the chosen media contact for the CC, with excerpts from her journal; news stories about the CC and the MWC events from Earth media as well as MWC media; background about the CC and the reasons for her being selected; excepts from minutes of meetings of the InterGalactic Council of the MWC; and much more. After the MWC educational resources and information become widely available, in 2013, all time is now known to be simultaneous. Writing from any point in time and timeline means that the love story and other aspects are depicted in multiple versions. Will Clara and her love, Epifanio Dang, be together? Which Re-set of the Transition After Public Contact prevails?Tone is humorous/serious; mode is utopian. Narrative and themes include history, poetry, literature, music/lyrics, science and technological advances, psi phenomena/ paranormal skills, law and government, Buddhism and other religions, meditation, social-emotional intelligence, multiverse/multiple timelines, time and space travel, interspecies communication, and social/futuristic depictions of the Earth, post-MWC public contact. \"This Changes Everything\" is the first of \"The Spanners Series,\" which chronicles the public contact between the CC and the MWC and the impact of these contacts on Earthers and the MWC over the almost 30 years that Clara is the CC. Chapters are written from several perspectives. Some Volumes in series are purported to be nonfiction or have nonfiction sections, as this one is.Sci-Fi/Romance/Speculative Fiction, Adult/ New Adult/YA genre novels are in the 10-volume series.

He begins to see past the cold armor she wears to protect herself from pain and finds a vulnerable and loving woman within. Now all he has to do, with a little help from old and new friends, is convince the pessimistic Lorelei that sometimes, changing times can be a blessing in disguise. \n", "genres": ["Romance"]}, "20429298": {"bookid": "20429298", "title": "The Golem & The Tzaddik", "author": "Charlayne Crawford", "series": "", "ratings": "6", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.50", "description": "Severe oppression and abuse by government agencies leads Anna to build a golem to get her justice!

She experiences numerous problems along the way that take Anna on an adventure into the spirit world. She also has to deal with the spirit world from the physical world.  She visits heaven during her meditation practices and is given 'holy stones' by the angel, Gabriel. She is unsure of what to do with them. Samael tries to trick her into giving them to him along the way.  Back in the physical realm, she is invaded by dybbuks and has to trap them in a dybbuk box.  Now she has dybbuks to figure out what to do with, and the 'holy stones' which have some sort of power, though Anna cannot seem to figure out, what that power is.  Finally, she builds a golem for justice in the physical realm.  A delightful tale of a tzaddik and her desire to see her lacha dodi face to face, amidst all of the trials and chaos.

It begins in our own backyard; Sydney, Australia.It\u2019s 2019 and the annual Zombie Horde Parade is about to commence in Sydney. Instead of the usual cast of jovial participants in fancy dress, the Sydney City CBD is inundated by a horde of zombies flooding out from the underground train station in Hyde Park and rampaging into an unsuspecting public. A large scale brawl erupts in the CBD as people suddenly realise that they aren\u2019t just defending themselves, they\u2019re fighting for their lives.We follow John\u2019s journey as he tries to escape the carnage and savagery. By the time he reaches safety, the media have only sketchy reports of the morning\u2019s events; while the police and riot squad are at a loss to understand the motives of the group responsible for the lethal riot that continues to rage. No matter who John runs into, their story is always the same; they were attacked by a group of psychopaths with an unrelenting thirst for violence and murder.The scourge of the undead rapidly spreads across the city as people make things worse by engaging in looting and vigilantism. With their attention diverted from the real enemy, hordes of zombies easily overrun entire suburbs within hours. Just when things look to be at their worst, the entire city is plunged into a blackout, allowing looters and thugs to add to the increasingly insurmountable difficulties people are already facing. John\u2019s struggle to survive begins with the knowledge that nowhere is completely safe.He knows that Sydney will inevitably fall into the grasping hands of the undead, and the thugs and other lowlifes will be there to victimise those not strong or smart enough to escape the necropolis.

Her family is in shambles after the death of her older sister Ina, and she's left to pick up the broken pieces of herself as her life heads into a downwards spiral of loneliness. Her heart leads her to 5:48, a little cafe by 33rd street, where she finds her new home. With a broken heart and a speech disability, Jasper has his heart and mouth sewn shut by the winding threads of hurt and fear. Painting and serving coffee in cafe 5:48 are one of his last few saving graces, but the smile he's been painting on himself will soon fade away as everything he's ever held dear slips away from his grasp. Ezra is out-of-sync and oddly cold by the way life has treated his young self. Abandoned by his single mother at an early age, he has grown up thinking that he is a mistake. His constant shaking hands is a reflection of what he often thinks of himself, but the delightful pastries he bakes for 5:48's customers are a reflection of what others see of him. Drew is a quirky rarity. He is a dash of loud, a pinch of exuberant, and a cup of eccentric \u2013 just like the meals he serves in the cafe as the only chef there. Behind his playful grins and outlandish clothes, however, are his jutting ribs, hollowed cheeks, and too-thin arms. Sometimes he cannot stomach being in his own skin as much as he cannot stomach food. This family has gone a long way from finding each other, and they'll be going a long way together too as reality comes catching up to them, threatening the newfound happiness they've found with each other. Secrets are revealed, pasts become presents, and lives are changed. Slowly but surely, they find their way back home.\n", "genres": ["Romance", "Contemporary", "Young Adult"]}, "19104103": {"bookid": "19104103", "title": "Carnal Abuse by Deceit: How a Predator's Lies Became Rape", "author": "Joyce Short", "series": "", "ratings": "14", "reviews": "3", "rating": "4.43", "description": "On-point and unsettling!

This rarely happens, and when it does it usually ends badly! And expecting it will cause you to let go of people who are steady, loving, and attentive, if you had given them a chance. So once you\u2019ve identified someone who makes you laugh, answers your messages, and is there for you when you want them, don\u2019t make the mistake of tossing them aside for the merely good-looking, sexy, or intriguing stranger.  If you\u2019re older, bad news: while you were spending time and effort on relationships you were hoping would turn out better, or even happily nestled in a good relationship or two, most of the secure, reliable, sane people in your age group got paired off. They\u2019re married or happily enfamilied, and most of the people your age in the dating pool are tragically unable to form a good long-term relationship. You should always ask yourself, \u201cwhy is this one still available?\u201d\u2014there may be a good answer (recently widowed or left a long-term relationship), or it may be that this person has just been extraordinarily unlucky in having over twenty short relationships in twenty years (to cite one case!) But it\u2019s far more likely you have met someone with a problematic attachment style. As you age past 40, the percentage of the dating pool that is able to form a secure, stable relationship drops to less than 30%[1]; and since it can take months of dating to understand why Mr. or Ms. SeemsNice is really the future ex-partner from Hell, being able to recognize the difficult types will help you recognize them faster and move on to the next.  This book outlines the basics (which might be all you need), and points you toward more resources if you want to understand more about your problem partner. If you're wondering if the guy or girl you've been hanging out with might not be quite right, this is the place to match those little red flags you've noticed with known bad types. And by getting out fast, you can avoid emotional damage and wasted time, and get going on finding someone who's really right for you. Study all of the bad types and you'll detect them before even getting involved. Or you could be one of the few people who recognizes their own problems in one of these types. There are study materials and plans of action for you, too.\n", "genres": ["Self Help", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Relationships"]}, "21468450": {"bookid": "21468450", "title": "Come Away with Me", "author": "Ruth Cardello", "series": "(The Andrades #1)", "ratings": "5076", "reviews": "337", "rating": "4.05", "description": "NY Times & USA Today Bestselling Author!Gio Andrade:Rich, powerful, sexy.

Using quantitative analysis of public opinion polls and presidential rhetoric pre- and post-9/11 in the news media, Bonn applies the moral panic concept to the Iraq war. He critiques the war and occupation of Iraq as violations of domestic and international law.

He moved to Virginia to work as a sales representative and after 22 years retired and moved to Colorado to live closer to his children and grandchildren.

It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of \"the African\"--Kunta Kinte\u2014but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the Lord Ligonier to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767.

He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. But Roots speaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.\n", "genres": []}, "3854232": {"bookid": "3854232", "title": "Shadows of the Heart", "author": "Lord' Williams", "series": "(The Unicorns #1)", "ratings": "22", "reviews": "11", "rating": "4.41", "description": "There are some affairs you simply cannot turn your back on-the connection cannot be severed-becoming shadows of the heart.

After five long years in federal prison, Griff Burkett is a free man. But the disgraced Cowboys quarterback can never return to life as he knew it before he was caught cheating. In a place where football is practically a religion, Griff committed a cardinal sin, and no one is forgiving.  Foster Speakman, owner and CEO of SunSouth Airlines, and his wife, Laura, are a golden couple. Successful and wealthy, they lived a charmed life before fate cruelly intervened and denied them the one thing they wanted most -- a child. It's said that money can't buy everything. But it can buy a disgraced football player fresh out of prison and out of prospects.  The job Griff agrees to do for the Speakmans demands secrecy. But he soon finds himself once again in the spotlight of suspicion. An unsolved murder comes back to haunt him in the form of his nemesis, Stanley Rodarte, who has made Griff's destruction his life's mission. While safeguarding his new enterprise, Griff must also protect those around him, especially Laura Speakman, from Rodarte's ruthlessness. Griff stands to gain the highest payoff he could ever imagine, but cashing in on it will require him to forfeit his only chance for redemption...and love.  Griff is now playing a high-stakes game, and at the final whistle, one player will be dead.  Play Dirty is Sandra Brown's wildest ride yet, with hairpin turns of plot all along the way. The clock is ticking down on a fallen football star, who lost everything because of the way he played the game.

Lacking an understanding of Joseph\u2019s condition, the family is left to deal with his upsetting transformation and subsequent homelessness. The perspectives of his three children, his spouse, and his own distorted reality combine to offer readers a glimpse of a world that will either feel hauntingly familiar or dramatically eye-opening. With so many recent tragedies involving individuals with untreated severe mental illness, families, doctors, and police are often blamed for not doing enough. The solution, however, is rarely simple. Losing Dad poignantly shows the effects of inadequate treatment for those living with a severe mental illness in America. Losing Dad not only features Joseph's harrowing -- and still ongoing -- flight from reality, but also valuable information about severe mental illness, a crippling disease that affects 1 in 17. Bonus: provides a list of resources, a discussion of current mental health laws, and exclusive family member interviews with several family members. Ideal for book clubs, reading discussion questions are included. The Foreword written by Xavier Amador,Ph.D., Founder, LEAP Institute and Author, I am Not Sick, I Don't Need Help!

At midnight along this street \u2013 with the sound of rock music pounding insistently out of club doors presided over by steroid-inflated bouncers, among men vomiting into the gutters \u2013 I saw children as young as six, unattended by adults, waiting for their parents to emerge from their nocturnal recreations.The doctor and consultant psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple looks at Great Britain - the nation which produced Newton and Darwin, Shakespeare and Dickens, David Hume and Adam Smith - and marvels at what it has become.Its inner cities and council estates are places where 'the whole gamut of human folly, wickedness, and misery may be perused at leisure... abortions procured by abdominal kung fu; children who have children; women abandoned by the father of their child a month before or a month after delivery; insensate jealousy; serial stepfatherhood that leads to sexual and physical abuse of children on a mass scale.'This timeless and beautifully-written collection of essays, looking at the collapse of the British way of life from an unashamedly conservative perspective, lays the blame squarely on the shoulders of the liberal intellectuals, who tend 'not to mean quite what they say, and express themselves more to flaunt the magnanimity of their intentions than to propagate truth.'When a well-known criminologist wrote that \"the normalisation of drug use is parallelled by the normalisation of crime\", and criminal behaviour no longer required special explanation, he surely didn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t mind if his own children started to shoot up heroin or rob old ladies in the street. Nor would he be indifferent to the intrusion of burglars into his own house.But, of course, it is the poor who are mugged and burgled, not the criminologists.The man\u2019s complacency was by no means unusual. A few days earlier I had met a publisher for lunch, and the subject of the general level of culture and education in England came up. The publisher is a cultivated man, widely read and deeply attached to literature, but I had difficulty in convincing him that there were grounds for concern. That illiteracy and innumeracy were widespread did not worry him in the least, because \u2013 he claimed \u2013 they had always been just as widespread. (The fact that we now spent four times as much per head on education as we did 50 years ago and were therefore entitled to expect rising rates of literacy and numeracy at the very least did not in the slightest knock him off his perch.) He simply did not believe me when I told him that nine of ten young people between the ages of 16 and 20 whom I met in my practice could not read with facility and were incapable of multiplying six by nine, or that out of several hundreds of them I had asked when the Second World War took place, only three knew the answer. He replied smoothly \u2013 almost without the need to think, as if he had rehearsed the argument many times \u2013 that his own son, age seven, already knew the dates of the war. \u2018The trouble is,\u2019 he said in all seriousness, \u2018your sample is biased.\u2019 True enough: everyone\u2019s experience is founded upon a biased sample. But it didn\u2019t occur to him to doubt whether his sample \u2013 of one, the son of a publisher living in a neighbourhood where houses usually cost more than \u00a3800,000 \u2013 really constituted a refutation of my experience of hundreds of cases, an experience borne out by all serious research into the matter.\n", "genres": ["Writing", "Sociology", "Culture", "Economics", "Philosophy", "Society", "Essays", "Cultural", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Politics", "History"]}, "21445984": {"bookid": "21445984", "title": "Rudy's Blueprint", "author": "Rudy Blunce", "series": "", "ratings": "7", "reviews": "5", "rating": "4.43", "description": "Societal help at a self-help level.

When living in Los Angeles, the author received phone calls from 1200 people in reaction to a campaign raised to help American Jews and other individuals file claims for property they had lost during the Nazi regime in what would later be Eastern Germany. Many of these phone calls were unrelated to the issue of filing the claims. On many occasions someone simply needed to talk to a complete stranger who lent a listening ear and understood. The conversations were usually long monologues about experiences in concentration camps like Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, even Sobibor. The victims talked about their escapes from the hands of the Nazi's, and about their harsh return after the liberation.When the process of filing claims was finished, the author found himself in the possession of a wealth of information, not only about the experiences of Holocaust survivors but also about the post-war generation. The personal, moving and candid witness statements and memories were all transcribed and verified, and provided shocking insights into the psychological aftermath of the first and second generation Holocaust victims.It was felt important to make these stories and memories accessible to a larger audience, especially to young people. The author Simon Hammelburg is a holocaust educator, lecturing in Europe, the United States and Israel. We should never forget what happened during World War II, and how this impacted generations to come. For countless people the war never ended.In this book, the memories of Holocaust survivors and their children have been intelligently woven into characters that play a role in the main storyline; the main character, himself a child from Jewish parents who both survived the Second World War, is trying to come to terms with the loss of a beloved one, Daisy, by traveling back to the place where they first met and were happy together. The book ends with the Kaddish for Daisy, attended by a circle of dear childhood friends, all of them from emotionally damaged and traumatized families. In their youth, they used to escape their homes on Sundays to meet at their Clubhouse from Ichud Habonim, a worldwide Zionist organization. The clubhouse served as a safehaven where they could be children and have fun.Although the tone of the book is generally serious, the author managed to give the book a gentle touch with his dry humor. In The War never Ended - Memories of Holocaust Survivors, Simon Hammelburg shows the trauma\u2019s of his parents\u2019 and of his own generation without ever becoming sentimental. They have been given a voice in an intelligent and natural way. The book is of rare literary quality with some great dialogues; once you start reading, you cannot put it down until you have read the very last page.The War Never Ended \u2013 Memories of Holocaust Survivors has been dedicated to Dr Flo Kinsler (1929-2013), a Los Angeles social worker and psychologist specialized in Holocaust trauma\u2019s.\n", "genres": ["Holocaust", "World War II", "War", "History"]}, "21900974": {"bookid": "21900974", "title": "City of Masks:", "author": "Ashley Capes", "series": "(Bone Mask Cycle #1)", "ratings": "480", "reviews": "94", "rating": "3.86", "description": "The gripping new adventure from the brilliant imagination of fantasy's new heir apparent - Ashley Capes\"Every now and then a writer comes along who will make you sit up and take notice - Ashley Capes delivers his stunning epic fantasy novel with a bang and serves notice on writers like Brandon Sanderson and George R R Martin: look out fellas - there's a new sheriff in town\nThe gripping new adventure from the brilliant imagination of fantasy's new heir apparent - Ashley Capes\"Every now and then a writer comes along who will make you sit up and take notice - Ashley Capes delivers his stunning epic fantasy novel with a bang and serves notice on writers like Brandon Sanderson and George R R Martin: look out fellas - there's a new sheriff in town...\" International Best Selling Fantasy author, Jennifer Fallon Waking in Anaskar Prison, covered in blood and accused of murder, nobody will listen to Notch\u2019s claims of innocence until he meets the future Protector of the Monarchy, Sofia Falco.But Sofia has her own burdens.

The banker revealed the wealth secret of the ages and why the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. An informative parable filled with investing, debt, and banking wisdom.Must read for anyone with a bank account.Why do the rich get richer and the poor get poorer? From earliest recorded history, mankind has been comprised of the haves and the have-nots. But what separates the two? This simple parable reveals the cause and effect relationship of why some get richer while most stay poor. It tells the tale of a common laborer on a journey of self-enlightenment, who stumbles upon the secret as to how the rich have increased their wealth from ancient times. It simplifies and sheds light on the mysterious world of banking, how they make their profits, and how to protect oneself from bank failures. It also reveals how banks and other institutional investors maximize their returns and how individuals can do the same. But be warned. This story's simple and direct style may make you uncomfortable, especially if your actions are making you poorer. Are you ready?Bankers are the bookies of our economy.The bankers are playing a game where the odds are in their favor and they know it. Yet they are prone to making mistakes that can have severe consequences for their depositors and society at large. But you can protect yourself from bank failures if you know what to look for. With a simple glance, you can determine which banks are healthy and which are not. Like the bankers, the big money institutional investors are also playing a game where the odds are in their favor. They play the financial markets how a casino plays against a gambler: According to their rules. This gives them a decided edge. But the good news is that with the proper knowledge anyone can duplicate these methods, regardless of their bankroll size.Like the banks, you can use the universal power of compound interest to reap windfall profits in a money game that will skew decidedly in your favor.

From his billet in Hamburg, a city razed to the ground by remorseless aerial bombardment, he witnesses a people and era on the brink of annihilation. This narrative presents a street-level view of a city reduced to rubble populated with refugees, black marketers, and cynical soldiers. At times grim and other times amusing, Smith writes a memoir relaying the social history about this time and place, providing a unique look at post-WWII Germany.

Bruno takes a page from \u201cHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cCatch-22,\u201d and Kurt Vonnegut to create something absolutely original: \u201cThe Weapon of My Delusion.\u201d The epic novel takes its place beside some of the greatest of the \u201cgenre-less\u201d books, leaping into a visionary take of the simple tune, \u201cHey Joe.\u201d Leaving a complex plot in the background and focusing on the character study, the characters of this crime story become the plot as a violent gunman seeks redemption.The man in the trench coat, simply known as Joe, had made a life for himself as the most lethal and profitable bounty hunter in the KBH gang. Things were going well for this hunter-of-men\u2026 that is, until it was reported that he had killed his true love. What the underworld next was asking was why?\u201cPerhaps it was best just to run now and ask questions later\u2026. Joe would be wandering at 90 MPH into the dark, unaware that those who had been his comrades would now begin lassoing their ropes about his neck, effortlessly, relentlessly, one by one.\u201dAnd so it was that his organization put a bounty on Joe\u2019s head, and of course, the police had some questions for him, too, for his organization was only rumored to exist. And to find him, would mean some classy book deals for all involved.But Joe\u2019s story isn\u2019t just another shoot-\u2018em-up; it\u2019s a tale that asks the question \u201cWhat makes right right, and wrong wrong?\u201d And more importantly: \u201cIf you give peace a chance, will it be so kind as to return to the favor?\u201dAt the center of this epic, outrageous chase across an America of the late twentieth century, are the three relationships that drive Joe - his \u201cwoman of the Euphrates\u201d whose death remains mystery, his relationship with the gang kingpin, Boss Samuels, who \u201cran the organization like a coach driver: a master whose control is derived by blinding servants to the chaos within,\u201d and a new woman, Nadine, who tries to convince him that the only life worth living is the one without the gun.This chase will change everything. First the motley assortment of bounty hunters, each with the merry ticks and musings over life-and-death. Do they follow the Code that has kept them strong, or follow their boss who seems to make his own rules (and to be honest, is probably insane)? On the other side is a police woman with a fire burning within, and a \u201cscorpion\u201d inside her brain \u2014 the gang of rappers who need to get more \u201cgangsta\u201d and find potential in the oncoming storm \u2014 the hippie who must decide how far he\u2019ll go to be Peace\u2019s bitch \u2014 and the bounty hunter himself who only wants to fade away like a ghost, but realizes that there is a weapon of delusion that is forcing him to face his past.\u201cThe Weapon of My Delusion\u201d is a rip-roaring, dark comedy crisscrossing the country; from California to Georgia, slums to mansions, Mexico to the Afterlife. And in the end, the triumphant may simply be the one who finds out that, though the pen is mightier than the sword, delusions are stronger than them all.\n", "genres": []}, "19738880": {"bookid": "19738880", "title": "We are Called to Rise", "author": "Laura  McBride", "series": "", "ratings": "13018", "reviews": "1972", "rating": "3.94", "description": "When an ice cream van is stopped at a cross roads, its brake light out, what are the chances its driver will be terrified by the police, his wife unable to communicate her distress as she tries to protect her children?

During that time, as I agonized over investing, saving and potential job loss, I developed an investment philosophy I dubbed the \"Financial Fortress\" and wrote a series of posts about it along with other posts about specific asset classes, investment strategies and related topics. My two biggest successes have been in real estate and precious metals. During the Great Recession, I made some aggressive moves, using retirement savings, to purchase distressed condominiums in Orange County, California. In addition to enjoying positive cash flow while I owned the properties, I have just completed one sale and have a second one in escrow, doubling my money in five years. I also made an aggressive move into silver (US Silver Eagle coins) to watch them triple in value, at which time I sold individual rolls on EBay and kept the rest for future appreciation. The essence of the Financial Fortress is that as savers and investors, we need to first have a strong defense before we can have a strong offense.

Wordsworth takes it upon himself to find out who these bones belong to and how they came to be there. In doing so, he uncovers a horrific tale of murder, incest and cannibalism that spreads throughout the neighbouring villages that surround Phooka Wood.Their investigation takes them to all corners of their roundabout world; from Mortal End to the oozing Hamlet of Stifle and Little Napoo. Along their colourful journey, we are introduced to a larger than life cast from Doc Sheare the barber surgeon, Verrye Brutall the handsome woodsman, Beliala Bigswoln the publican\u2019s daughter, Baron Rubigo Bluebeard and Umbra the Bogyman.Everyone seems to have a secret that they are trying to hide that could give clues to the horror of Phooka Wood.

Her characters are original and fascinating and leap off the page. She is a smart writer with the ability to make a story exciting and mysterious and will take your breath away.\" - LA WRITERS CENTERMortal End: A Simmering Pit Of Jiggery Pokery, the debut novel from Toula Mavridou-Messer, was written in the space of three weeks after two car crashes in just one hour. Even the rescue serviceman who came to collect her from the mangled wreckage was hesitant about transporting her, saying, \"Things happen in threes, don't they?\"\"It's a sign,\" thought Toula, as those crashes came during the return journey from a residential crime writing course she attended, given by best-selling author Val McDermid. She had been battling a major problem faced by so many would-be authors - that of actually finishing a project and then doing something with it.Facing death head on seems to have been the antidote, although not necessarily recommended as a remedy for all. Every time Toula was faced with either a blank page or the option of walking away from the type-writer, she remembered that she had been spared a fate worse than death...or in fact, death and that small fact kept her chained to her desk.Fortunately she saw the funny side and hopefully so will you when you read Mortal End: A Simmering Pit Of Jiggery Pokery, available from Amazon, Kindle and Barnes & Noble.\n", "genres": ["Mystery", "Fantasy"]}, "21403040": {"bookid": "21403040", "title": "Catching Lightning Without the Bottle", "author": "Timothy F.

Senior Jason Curran is the epitome of the Northport student: an Australian martial artist who speaks fifteen languages and majors simultaneously in Neuroscience and Engineering.

Northport is no different: if he is a perfect fit on paper, the brilliant but reclusive student does not fit in on campus, whose hidden social curriculum he fails to navigate, instead focusing obsessively, and alone, on a mysterious project. Overnight, Jason's orderly life is thrown upside down when Northport abruptly and inexplicably suspends him based on grave allegations. Can he restore his reputation and overcome his social isolation, which is brought to a whole new level by these accusations? Turmoil, romance, exotic locations, and a relentless investigation by a determined Northport Dean are all brought together in Jason's thrilling multi-continent quest for understanding, invention, redemption, and the realization that social awkwardness is not a crime.\n", "genres": []}, "23135840": {"bookid": "23135840", "title": "A Quick Journey From Being Single to Somebody's World", "author": "Sahithi Setikam", "series": "", "ratings": "5", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.80", "description": "This is a no nonsense approach eBook intended for, people who want \"TO START (singles and soon to be singles) OR IMPROVE (dysfunctional relationships, low self-esteems, attitude problems, etc.) A RELATIONSHIP\".Unconditional love doesn't happen overnight, it is a gradual process. love, live and let others do the same.\nThis is a no nonsense approach eBook intended for, people who want \"TO START (singles and soon to be singles) OR IMPROVE (dysfunctional relationships, low self-esteems, attitude problems, etc.) A RELATIONSHIP\".Unconditional love doesn't happen overnight, it is a gradual process. love, live and let others do the same.\n", "genres": []}, "16127331": {"bookid": "16127331", "title": "Amber and Blue", "author": "K.R.
