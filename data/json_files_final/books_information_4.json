In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), often called the Nazi bible, Hitler describes his life, frustrations, ideals, and dreams. Born to an impoverished couple in a small town in Austria, the young Adolf grew up with the fervent desire to become a painter. The death of his parents and outright rejection from art schools in Vienna forced him into underpaid work as a laborer. During the First World War, Hitler served in the infantry and was decorated for bravery. After the war, he became actively involved with socialist political groups and quickly rose to power, establishing himself as Chairman of the National Socialist German Worker's party. In 1924, Hitler led a coalition of nationalist groups in a bid to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich. The infamous Munich \"Beer-hall putsch\" was unsuccessful, and Hitler was arrested. During the nine months he was in prison, an embittered and frustrated Hitler dictated a personal manifesto to his loyal follower Rudolph Hess. He vented his sentiments against communism and the Jewish people in this document, which was to become Mein Kampf, the controversial book that is seen as the blue-print for Hitler's political and military campaign.

In Rome, a Vatican archaeologist is found dead in St. Peter's Basilica. In Africa, a U.S. senator's son is slain outside a Red Cross camp. The three murders on three continents bear a horrifying connection: all the victims are marked by a Druidic pagan cross burned into their flesh.The bizarre murders thrust Commander Gray Pierce and Sigma Force into a race against time to solve a riddle going back centuries, to a ghastly crime against humanity hidden within a cryptic medieval codex. The first clue is discovered inside a mummified corpse buried in an English peat bog -- a gruesome secret that threatens America and the world.Aided by two women from his past -- one his exlover, the other his new partner -- Gray must piece together the horrifying truth. But the revelations come at a high cost, and to save the future, Gray will have to sacrifice one of the women at his side. That alone might not be enough, as the true path to salvation is revealed in a dark prophecy of doom.Sigma Force confronts humankind's greatest threat in an adventure that races from the Roman Coliseum to the icy peaks of Norway, from the ruins of medieval abbeys to the lost tombs of Celtic kings. The ultimate nightmare is locked within a talisman buried by a dead saint -- an ancient artifact known as the Doomsday Key.\n", "genres": ["Mystery", "Science Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Action", "Thriller", "Audiobook", "Adventure", "Suspense", "Historical"]}, "222078": {"bookid": "222078", "title": "The Story of Art", "author": "E.H.

This Penguin Classics edition of The Complete Essays is translated from the French and edited with an introduction and notes by M.A. Screech.In 1572 Montaigne retired to his estates in order to devote himself to leisure, reading and reflection. There he wrote his constantly expanding 'assays', inspired by the ideas he found in books contained in his library and from his own experience. He discusses subjects as diverse as war-horses and cannibals, poetry and politics, sex and religion, love and friendship, ecstasy and experience.

Coriolanus is one of Shakespeare's harshest and most challenging studies of power, politics and masculinity, based around the life of Caius Marcius.  Based on the Roman chronicles of Plutarch's Lives and Livy's History of Rome, the play is set in the early years of the Roman Republic. Its famous opening scene, particularly admired by Bertolt Brecht, portrays its citizens as starving and rebellious, and horrified by the arrogant and dismissive attitude of Caius Marcius, one of Rome's most valiant but also political naive soldiers. Spurred on by his ambitious mother Volumnia, Caius takes the city of Corioles, is renamed Coriolanus in honour of his victory, and is encouraged to run for senate. However, his contempt for the citizens, who he calls \"scabs\" and \"musty superfluity\" ultimately leads to his exile and destructive alliance with his deadly foe, Aufidius. Despite its relative unpopularity, Coriolanus is a fascinating study of both public and personal life. Its language is dense and complex, as its representation of the tensions built into the fabric of Roman political life. Yet it also contains extraordinarily intimate scenes between Coriolanus and both his mother, who ultimately proves \"most mortal\" to her own son, and his enemy Aufidius, whose \"rapt heart\" is happier to see Coriolanus than his own wife.

As human beings, we all have the ability, and even the proclivity, to philosophize. We all engage in philosphical thought in the course of our daily live. What is philosophy? Why is it important? The importance of philosophy can be summed up in two words: Great Ideas. Great Ideas are the ideas that have been captured and developed in what are often called the Great Books of Western Civilization. They are common concepts that are a part of everyone's vocabulary and ordinary conversation and important, basic ideas that we think about throughout our lives - as children, adolescents and adults. What does it mean to be Good? How do we decide the Right thing to do? What is Love? The same question may appear to have different answers; the journey through the conflicting answers to a resolution is called philosophy. The Great Ideas are Art, Beauty, Change, Democracy, Emotion, Freedom, God, Good and Evil, Government, Justice, Labour, Language, Law, Learning, Love, Man, Opinion, Philosophy, Progress, Punishment, Truth, and War and Peace. Although everyone has a basic grasp of these Great Ideas, not everyone understands them as well as he or she could or should. In \"How to Think About the Great Ideas\", renowned philosopher Mortimer J. Adler guides readers to an understanding of these fundamental ideas and their practical applications to our daily lives. Not only does he clarify what the Great Ideas are, he helps readers understand the immediate role/application and importance of these ideas in our lives.

A-Ma is a historical spiritual novel set in the 17th century (Age of Enlightenment) Macao that follows lives and spiritual insights of settlers of this little peninsula in the middle of China. A-Ma main protagonist is Ama, an African alchemist, Goddess, a guru, a lover, a story-teller that inspires and gathers artists, preachers, priests, philosophers from all around the world within the magic settings of her coffee house. She believes in a spiritual truth that we all can live our highest potential, discovering the gold within. Traveling through space and time, we find ourselves in the midst of an amazing blend of Chinese, Portuguese and Africans that live together on this little peninsula. This magic place, that is rapidly growing as a centre of trade offers a pot for the highest alchemy practice ever, the alchemy of humanity, creating an energy matrix that will change the lives of generations to come.We are transferred into the time of strong religious clashes and dogmas, and the scientific revolution, where our protagonists join the fight of the enlightened minds of the time, such as Giordano Bruno and Da-Vinci for the establishment of the New World. Through Ruben, a Portuguese Jesuit Priest who came to China to convert the Chinese into Christians, and through Ama and her family, friends, followers and enemies, we enter into the insights and challenges of the time they lived in, we join their attempts to learn from both the Eastern and Western philosophy, and we witness their personal inner transformation. In China some prominent historical events shaped the future of Western and Eastern philosophical thought and civilization. All the events and manuscripts mentioned within the book: the Dutch attack to Macao 24th of June 1622, the Reform of the Chinese Calendar during 1630s, Father Schall\u2019s Appointment to the Chinese Board of Mathematicians (during 1650s), Witches Hunt, and Witches Manual, etc, are carefully researched historical facts. The book uses history to create the connection between actions of the individuals that live surrounded by magic. A-Ma takes us on an exploration journey discovering the secrets of the bond we all have created during the millions of life-times on Earth, the bond of consciousness and suffering.

Although capitalism could have only grown to current levels in the soil of democracies, Benjamin Barber argues that global capitalism now tends to work against the very concept of citizenship, of people thinking for themselves and with their neighbors. Too often now, how we think is the product of a transnational corporation (increasingly, a media corporation) with headquarters elsewhere. And although self-determination is one of the most fundamental of democratic principles, unchecked it has lead to a tribalism (think Bosnia, think Rwanda) in which virtually no one besides the local power elite gets a fair shake. The antidote, Barber concludes, is to work everywhere to resuscitate the non-governmental, non-business spaces in life--he calls them \"civic spaces\" (such as the village green, voluntary associations of every sort, churches, community schools)--where true citizenship thrives.\n", "genres": ["Economics", "War", "Religion", "Sociology", "Politics", "Terrorism", "International Relations", "Nonfiction", "Islam", "History", "Political Science"]}, "99894": {"bookid": "99894", "title": "The Boys from Brazil", "author": "Ira Levin", "series": "", "ratings": "37175", "reviews": "981", "rating": "4.06", "description": "Alive and hiding in South America, the fiendish Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele gathers a group of former colleagues for a horrifying project\u2014the creation of the Fourth Reich.

He lives in a small English village with his wife, Maureen, who seems irritated by almost everything he does, even down to how he butters his toast. Little differentiates one day from the next. Then one morning the mail arrives, and within the stack of quotidian minutiae is a letter addressed to Harold in a shaky scrawl from a woman he hasn't seen or heard from in twenty years. Queenie Hennessy is in hospice and is writing to say goodbye. Harold pens a quick reply and, leaving Maureen to her chores, heads to the corner mailbox. But then, as happens in the very best works of fiction, Harold has a chance encounter, one that convinces him that he absolutely must deliver his message to Queenie in person. And thus begins the unlikely pilgrimage. Harold Fry is determined to walk six hundred miles from Kingsbridge to the hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed because, he believes, as long as he walks, Queenie Hennessey will live. Still in his yachting shoes and light coat, Harold embarks on his urgent quest across the countryside. Along the way he meets one character after another, each of whom unlocks his long-dormant spirit and sense of promise. Memories of his first dance with Maureen, his wedding day, his joy in fatherhood, come rushing back to him - allowing him to also reconcile the losses and the regrets. As for Maureen, she finds herself missing Harold for the first time in years. And then there is the unfinished business with Queenie Hennessy.\n", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Adult Fiction", "Adult", "Novels", "Fiction", "Book Club", "Audiobook", "Contemporary", "Travel"]}, "35001887": {"bookid": "35001887", "title": "Outsourced World - Seducing Goddess Durga During the Clinton Era", "author": "GRWilson", "series": "", "ratings": "119", "reviews": "3", "rating": "4.19", "description": "This forthright narrative chronicles the author\u2019s 1996 experiences as he adjusts to a massively transformed world.

In Th\nCreativity is not a gift from the gods, says Twyla Tharp, bestowed by some divine and mystical spark. It is the product of preparation and effort, and it's within reach of everyone who wants to achieve it. All it takes is the willingness to make creativity a habit, an integral part of your life: In order to be creative, you have to know how to prepare to be creative. In The Creative Habit, Tharp takes the lessons she has learned in her remarkable thirty-five-year career and shares them with you, whatever creative impulses you follow -- whether you are a painter, composer, writer, director, choreographer, or, for that matter, a businessperson working on a deal, a chef developing a new dish, a mother wanting her child to see the world anew.  When Tharp is at a creative dead end, she relies on a lifetime of exercises to help her get out of the rut, and The Creative Habit contains more than thirty of them to ease the fears of anyone facing a blank beginning and to open the mind to new possibilities.  Tharp's exercises are practical and immediately doable -- for the novice or expert. In \"Where's Your Pencil?\" she reminds us to observe the world -- and get it down on paper. In \"Coins and Chaos,\" she provides the simplest of mental games to restore order and peace. In \"Do a Verb,\" she turns your mind and body into coworkers. In \"Build a Bridge to the Next Day,\" she shows how to clean your cluttered mind overnight.  To Tharp, sustained creativity begins with rituals, self-knowledge, harnessing your memories, and organizing your materials (so no insight is ever lost).

Sixteen minutes later the unthinkable happens: The plane plunges into the ocean. The only survivors are Scott Burroughs - the painter - and a four-year-old boy who is now the last remaining member of an immensely wealthy and powerful media mogul's family. With chapters weaving between the aftermath of the crash and the backstories of the passengers and crew members - including a Wall Street titan and his wife, a Texan-born party boy just in from London, a young woman questioning her path in life, and a career pilot - the mystery surrounding the tragedy heightens. As the passengers' intrigues unravel, odd coincidences point to a conspiracy. Was it merely by dumb chance that so many influential people perished? Or was something far more sinister at work? Events soon threaten to spiral out of control in an escalating storm of media outrage and accusations. And while Scott struggles to cope with fame that borders on notoriety, the authorities scramble to salvage the truth from the wreckage. Amid pulse-quickening suspense, the fragile relationship between Scott and the young boy glows at the heart of this stunning novel, raising questions of fate, human nature, and the inextricable ties that bind us together.\n", "genres": ["Mystery", "Adult", "Mystery Thriller", "Adult Fiction", "Fiction", "Thriller", "Audiobook", "Contemporary", "Crime", "Suspense"]}, "174834": {"bookid": "174834", "title": "The Cost of Discipleship", "author": "Dietrich Bonhoeffer", "series": "", "ratings": "40214", "reviews": "1357", "rating": "4.27", "description": "One of the most important theologians of the twentieth century illuminates the relationship between ourselves and the teachings of Jesus in this classic text on ethics, humanism, and civic duty.What can the call to discipleship, the adherence to the word of Jesus, mean today to the businessman, the soldier, the laborer, or the aristocrat?

In response, three young men - the aristocratic Liu Xuande, the fugitive Lord Guan, and the pig-butcher Zhang Fei - meet to pledge eternal brotherhood and fealty to their beleaguered government.

What was this great political enterprise all about? Who were these people who are considered the philosophical, spiritual, and moral ancestors of our nation? What Vowell discovers is something far different from what their uptight shoe-buckles-and-corn reputation might suggest. The people she finds are highly literate, deeply principled, and surprisingly feisty. Their story is filled with pamphlet feuds, witty courtroom dramas, and bloody vengeance. Along the way she asks:Was Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop a communitarian, Christlike Christian, or conformity's tyrannical enforcer? Yes! Was Rhode Island's architect Roger Williams America's founding freak or the father of the First Amendment? Same difference. What does it take to get that jezebel Anne Hutchinson to shut up? A hatchet. What was the Puritans' pet name for the Pope? The Great Whore of Babylon. Sarah Vowell's special brand of armchair history makes the bizarre and esoteric fascinatingly relevant and fun. She takes us from the modern-day reenactment of an Indian massacre to the Mohegan Sun casino, from old-timey Puritan poetry, where \"righteousness\" is rhymed with \"wilderness,\" to a Mayflower-themed waterslide.

Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany, she has one affair after another, including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming\u2014yet wholly sinister\u2014Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity.

Nowhere is this truth more apparent than in the scrapbook of recipes she has inherited from her dead mother.With this book, Framboise re-creates her mother's dishes, which she serves in her small creperie. And yet as she studies the scrapbook - searching for clues to unlock the contradiction between her mother's sensuous love of food and often cruel demeanor - she begins to recognize a deeper meaning behind Mirabelle's cryptic scribbles. Within the journal's tattered pages lies the key to what actually transpired the summer Framboise was nine years old.Rich and dark.

She should be heard.\" \u2014The New York TimesAngela Davis provides a powerful history of the social and political influence of whiteness and elitism in feminism, from abolitionist days to the present, and demonstrates how the racist and classist biases of its leaders inevitably hampered any collective ambitions. While Black women were aided by some activists like Sarah and Angelina Grimke and the suffrage cause found unwavering support in Frederick Douglass, many women played on the fears of white supremacists for political gain rather than take an intersectional approach to liberation. Here, Davis not only contextualizes the legacy and pitfalls of civil and women's rights activists, but also discusses Communist women, the murder of Emmitt Till, and Margaret Sanger's racism. Davis shows readers how the inequalities between Black and white women influence the contemporary issues of rape, reproductive freedom, housework and child care in this bold and indispensable work.\n", "genres": ["Sociology", "Feminism", "Politics", "Social Movements", "Theory", "Anti Racist", "Social Justice", "Nonfiction", "Race", "History", "Gender", "Philosophy"]}, "21855259": {"bookid": "21855259", "title": "The Secret History of Wonder Woman", "author": "Jill Lepore", "series": "", "ratings": "15609", "reviews": "2259", "rating": "3.72", "description": "A cultural history of Wonder Woman traces the character's creation and enduring popularity, drawing on interviews and archival research to reveal the pivotal role of feminism in shaping her seven-decade story.Examines the life of Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston and his polyamorous relationship with wife Elizabeth Holloway and mistress Olive Byrne, both of whom\nA cultural history of Wonder Woman traces the character's creation and enduring popularity, drawing on interviews and archival research to reveal the pivotal role of feminism in shaping her seven-decade story.Examines the life of Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston and his polyamorous relationship with wife Elizabeth Holloway and mistress Olive Byrne, both of whom inspired and influenced the comic book character's creation and development.-Abstract from WorldCat\n", "genres": ["Biography", "Culture", "Feminism", "Womens", "Nonfiction", "Sequential Art", "Comics", "Audiobook", "Pop Culture", "History", "Historical", "Superheroes"]}, "10909": {"bookid": "10909", "title": "The Tenth Circle", "author": "Jodi Picoult", "series": "", "ratings": "124198", "reviews": "5877", "rating": "3.52", "description": "Fourteen-year-old Trixie Stone is in love for the first time.

Written in what DeLillo calls \"super-omniscience\" the sentences sweep from young Cotter Martin as he jumps the gate to the press box, soars over the radio waves, runs out to the diamond, slides in on a fast ball, pops into the stands where J. Edgar Hoover is sitting with a drunken Jackie Gleason and a splenetic Frank Sinatra, and learns of the Soviet Union's second detonation of a nuclear bomb. It's an absolutely thrilling literary moment. When Bobby Thomson hits Branca's pitch into the outstretched hand of Cotter\u2014the \"shot heard around the world\"\u2014and Jackie Gleason pukes on Sinatra's shoes, the events of the next few decades are set in motion, all threaded together by the baseball as it passes from hand to hand.\"It's all falling indelibly into the past,\" writes DeLillo, a past that he carefully recalls and reconstructs with acute grace. Jump from Giants Stadium to the Nevada desert in 1992, where Nick Shay, who now owns the baseball, reunites with the artist Kara Sax. They had been brief and unlikely lovers 40 years before, and it is largely through the events, spinoffs, and coincidental encounters of their pasts that DeLillo filters the Cold War experience. He believes that \"global events may alter how we live in the smallest ways,\" and as the book steps back in time to 1951, over the following 800-odd pages, we see just how those events alter lives. This reverse narrative allows the author to strip away the detritus of history and pop culture until we get to the story's pure elements: the bomb, the baseball, and the Bronx. In an epilogue as breathless and stunning as the prologue, DeLillo fast-forwards to a near future in which ruthless capitalism, the Internet, and a new, hushed faith have replaced the Cold War's blend of dread and euphoria.Through fragments and interlaced stories\u2014including those of highway killers, artists, celebrities, conspiracists, gangsters, nuns, and sundry others\u2014DeLillo creates a fragile web of connected experience, a communal Zeitgeist that encompasses the messy whole of five decades of American life, wonderfully distilled.\n", "genres": ["20th Century", "Literary Fiction", "American", "Classics", "Historical Fiction", "Novels", "Literature", "Fiction", "Americana", "Contemporary", "Historical"]}, "11424443": {"bookid": "11424443", "title": "Martin Swans Diary: Black Water Crossing", "author": "Kyle Keyes", "series": "", "ratings": "1645", "reviews": "16", "rating": "4.41", "description": "Martin Swan was not a terrorist, nor a truck driver.

Following an Australian government edict in 1931, black aboriginal children and children of mixed marriages were gathered up by whites and taken to settlements to be assimilated. In Rabbit-Proof Fence, award-winning author Doris Pilkington traces the captivating story of her mother, Molly, one of three young girls uprooted from her community in Southwestern Australia and taken to the Moore River Native Settlement. At the settlement, Milly and her relatives Gracie and Daisy were forbidden to speak their native language, forced to abandon their aboriginal heritage, and taught to be culturally white. After regular stays in solitary confinement, the three girls scared and homesick planned and executed a daring escape from the grim camp, with its harsh life of padlocks, barred windows, and hard cold beds.The girls headed for the nearby rabbit-proof fence that stretched over 1,000 miles through the desert toward their home. Their journey lasted over a month, and they survived on everything from emus to feral cats, while narrowly avoiding the police, professional trackers, and hostile white settlers. Their story is a truly moving tale of defiance and resilience.About the author: Doris Pilkington is also the author of Caprice: A Stockman's Daughter.

Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other\u2019s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Africa.We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist\u2019s couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city\u2019s demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale.

In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both\u2014and escape the merciless progress of time\u2014in the transporting realms of art and music.

There was still the incredulousness, still the sense of hearing something that couldn't possibly be true. And yet he knew it was.

And so, finally, with a wonder of his own, he said, \"Yes, Joseph, I believe you.\"Pillar of Light \u2014 the first volume in the series The Work and the Glory \u2014 begins the epic story of the Benjamin Steed family. In the 1820s they move from Vermont to Palmyra Township in upstate New York in search of better farmland. There they meet a young man named Joseph Smith and are thrown into the maelstrom of conflict and controversy that swirls around him. Did he really see the Father and the Son in a pillar of light? Has he truly been visited by angelic messengers? What is all this talk about gold plates and new scripture? In short, is he a prophet and seer or a monumental fraud? The answers each one gives to these questions \u2014 intensely personal, potentially divisive \u2014 will dramatically affect the lives of the Steeds forever after.Author Gerald N. Lund here masterfully weaves together historical reality and high-powered fiction. In his hands this combination seems to make the reader an eyewitness to the early scenes of the Restoration, thus deepening one's understanding and appreciation of those momentous events. The well-drawn plot and fictional characters present a moving, gripping story. Here are Benjamin and Mary Ann Steed, devoted to each other as man and wife, yet at odds over religion; Joshua, their volatile son, who rebels and heads for trouble; the sensitive Nathan, their second son, in whom Joseph Smith's message strikes a responsive chord; the beautiful Lydia McBride, who captures the hearts of both Joshua and Nathan.This book skillfully explores the inmost motivations of Joseph Smith and his early followers and the responses of typical contemporary families to the claims he made. These people come to life in this powerful historical novel, a story that captures both the heartache and the happiness that came in the wake of Joseph's experience with the pillar of light.\n", "genres": ["Christian", "Lds Fiction", "Religion", "Adult", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Christianity", "Church", "Historical", "Christian Fiction", "Lds"]}, "2331954": {"bookid": "2331954", "title": "Infected", "author": "Scott Sigler", "series": "(Infected #1)", "ratings": "20057", "reviews": "1754", "rating": "3.84", "description": "Across America a mysterious disease is turning ordinary people into raving, paranoid murderers who inflict brutal horrors on strangers, themselves, and even their own families.

The secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships--so that everyone wins. In \"Never Eat Alone,\" Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps--and inner mindset--he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him. The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington's corridors of power to Hollywood's A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain's 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum. Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with \"networking.\" He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them: Don't keep score: It's never simply about getting what you want. It's about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too. \"Ping\" constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time--not just when you need something. Never eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you're working at a corporation or attending a society event-- \"invisibility\" is a fate worse than failure. In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world's most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama. Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a \"conference commando,\" and more, \"Never Eat Alone\" is destined to take its place alongside \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" as an inspirational classic.\n", "genres": ["Language", "Business", "Psychology", "Relationships", "Communication", "Management", "Personal Development", "Leadership", "Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Buisness"]}, "29450874": {"bookid": "29450874", "title": "The Truth of All that Is: The Angel book to Enlightenment and Personal Transformation", "author": "Amelia Bert", "series": "", "ratings": "88", "reviews": "19", "rating": "4.48", "description": "\u201cThis book is a great treasure for me and it will always stay with me always.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm new to spirituality and I was looking to understand how everything really works.

The twentieth century\u2014a time of unprecedented progress\u2014has produced a tremendous strain on the very elements that comprise life itself: This raises the key question of the twenty-first century: How much longer can this go on? With wit and erudition, Ronald Wright lays out a-convincing case that history has always provided an answer, whether we care to notice or not. From Neanderthal man to the Sumerians to the Roman Empire, A Short History of Progress dissects the cyclical nature of humanity's development and demise, the 10,000-year old experiment that we've unleashed but have yet to control. It is Wright's contention that only by understanding and ultimately breaking from the patterns of progress and disaster that humanity has repeated around the world since the Stone Age can we avoid the onset of a new Dark Age. Wright illustrates how various cultures throughout history have literally manufactured their own end by producing an overabundance of innovation and stripping bare the very elements that allowed them to initially advance.

It is 1946, and city-bred Laura McAllan is trying to raise her children on her husband's Mississippi Delta farm - a place she finds foreign and frightening. In the midst of the family's struggles, two young men return from the war to work the land. Jamie McAllan, Laura's brother-in-law, is everything her husband is not - charming, handsome, and haunted by his memories of combat. Ronsel Jackson, eldest son of the black sharecroppers who live on the McAllan farm, has come home with the shine of a war hero. But no matter his bravery in defense of his country, he is still considered less than a man in the Jim Crow South. It is the unlikely friendship of these brothers-in-arms that drives this powerful novel to its inexorable conclusion. The men and women of each family relate their versions of events and we are drawn into their lives as they become players in a tragedy on the grandest scale.

Now Greene has once again mined history and literature to distill the essence of seduction, the most highly refined mode of influence, the ultimate power trip. The Art of Seduction is a masterful synthesis of the work of thinkers such as Freud, Ovid, Kierkegaard, and Einstein, as well as the achievements of the greatest seducers throughout history. From Cleopatra to John F. Kennedy, from Andy Warhol to Josephine Bonaparte, The Art of Seduction gets to the heart of the character of the seducer and his or her tactics, triumphs and failures. The seducer's many faces include: the Siren, the Rake, the Ideal Lover, the Dandy, the Natural, the Coquette, the Charmer, and the Charismatic. Twenty-four maneuvers will guide readers through the seduction process, providing cunning, amoral instructions for and analysis of this fascinating, all-pervasive form of power. Just as beautifully packaged and every bit as essential as The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction is an indispensable primer of persuasion and offers the best lessons on how to take what you want from whomever you want or how to prevent yourself from being taken.\n", "genres": ["Business", "Psychology", "Relationships", "Sexuality", "Personal Development", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook", "Self Help", "History", "Philosophy"]}, "78950": {"bookid": "78950", "title": "Little Men", "author": "Louisa May Alcott", "series": "(Little Women #2)", "ratings": "57464", "reviews": "2289", "rating": "3.86", "description": "With two sons of her own, and twelve rescued orphan boys filling the informal school at Plumfield, Jo March -- now Jo Bhaer -- couldn't be happier.

A gripping hour-by-hour account told through the eyes of the hunted and the hunters, this is history as you've never read it before.The murder of Abraham Lincoln set off the greatest manhunt in American history -- the pursuit and capture of John Wilkes Booth. From April 14 to April 26, 1865, the assassin led Union cavalry and detectives on a wild twelve-day chase through the streets of Washington, D.C., across the swamps of Maryland, and into the forests of Virginia, while the nation, still reeling from the just-ended Civil War, watched in horror and sadness. At the very center of this story is John Wilkes Booth, America's notorious villain. A Confederate sympathizer and a member of a celebrated acting family, Booth threw away his fame and wealth for a chance to avenge the South's defeat. For almost two weeks, he confounded the manhunters, slipping away from their every move and denying them the justice they sought.

He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage, scrupulous logic, and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher, writer, and teacher has been famous. These qualities make the essays included in this book perhaps the most graceful and moving presentation of the freethinker's position since the days of Hume and Voltaire.  \"I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue,\" Russell declares in his Preface, and his reasoned opposition to any system or dogma which he feels may shackle man's mind runs through all the essays in this book, whether they were written as early as 1899 or as late as 1954.  The book has been edited, with Lord Russell's full approval and cooperation, by Professor Paul Edwards of the Philosophy Department of New York University.

But her new home, while splendorous, is not welcoming. Johannes is kind yet distant, always locked in his study or at his warehouse office--leaving Nella alone with his sister, the sharp-tongued and forbidding Marin.But Nella's world changes when Johannes presents her with an extraordinary wedding gift: a cabinet-sized replica of their home. To furnish her gift, Nella engages the services of a miniaturist--an elusive and enigmatic artist whose tiny creations mirror their real-life counterparts in eerie and unexpected ways . . .Johannes' gift helps Nella to pierce the closed world of the Brandt household. But as she uncovers its unusual secrets, she begins to understand--and fear--the escalating dangers that await them all. In this repressively pious society where gold is worshipped second only to God, to be different is a threat to the moral fabric of society, and not even a man as rich as Johannes is safe. Only one person seems to see the fate that awaits them. Is the miniaturist the key to their salvation . . . or the architect of their destruction?Enchanting, beautiful, and exquisitely suspenseful, The Miniaturist is a magnificent story of love and obsession, betrayal and retribution, appearance and truth.\n", "genres": ["Mystery", "Fantasy", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Book Club", "Audiobook", "Magical Realism", "Historical"]}, "16790": {"bookid": "16790", "title": "Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fiction and Illusions", "author": "Neil Gaiman", "series": "", "ratings": "68538", "reviews": "3133", "rating": "4.02", "description": "In the deft hands of\u00a0Neil Gaiman, magic is no mere illusion... and anything is possible.

Carl Sagan is considered one of the greatest scientific minds of our time. His remarkable ability to explain science in terms easily understandable to the layman in bestselling books such as Cosmos, The Dragons of Eden, and The Demon-Haunted World won him a Pulitzer Prize and placed him firmly next to Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and Oliver Sachs as one of the most important and enduring communicators of science. In December 2006 it will be the tenth anniversary of Sagan's death, and Ann Druyan, his widow and longtime collaborator, will mark the occasion by releasing Sagan's famous \"Gifford Lectures in Natural Theology,\" The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God.  The chance to give the Gifford Lectures is an honor reserved for the most distinguished scientists and philosophers of our civilization. In 1985, on the grand occasion of the centennial of the lectureship, Carl Sagan was invited to give them. He took the opportunity to set down in detail his thoughts on the relationship between religion and science as well as to describe his own personal search to understand the nature of the sacred in the vastness of the cosmos.  The Varieties of Scientific Experience, edited, updated and with an introduction by Ann Druyan, is a bit like eavesdropping on a delightfully intimate conversation with the late great astronomer and astrophysicist. In his charmingly down-to-earth voice, Sagan easily discusses his views on topics ranging from manic depression and the possibly chemical nature of transcendance to creationism and so-called intelligent design to the likelihood of intelligent life on other planets to the likelihood of nuclear annihilation of our own to a new concept of science as \"informed worship.\" Exhibiting a breadth of intellect nothing short of astounding, he illuminates his explanations with examples from cosmology, physics, philosophy, literature, psychology, cultural anthropology, mythology, theology, and more. Sagan's humorous, wise, and at times stunningly prophetic observations on some of the greatest mysteries of the cosmos have the invigorating effect of stimulating the intellect, exciting the imagination, and reawakening us to the grandeur of life in the cosmos.\n", "genres": ["Astronomy", "Religion", "Theology", "Atheism", "Science", "Spirituality", "Nonfiction", "Physics", "Skepticism", "Philosophy"]}, "48462": {"bookid": "48462", "title": "Collected Works: Wise Blood / A Good Man is Hard to Find / The Violent Bear it Away / Everything that Rises Must Converge / Essays and Letters", "author": "Flannery O'Connor", "series": "", "ratings": "3217", "reviews": "198", "rating": "4.51", "description": "In her short lifetime, Flannery O'Connor became one of the most distinctive American writers of the twentieth century.

It might be a new hat or clean hogs or, for Hazel Motes, hero of Wise Blood (1952), an automobile. \"Nobody with a good car needs to be justified,\" Hazel assures himself while using its hood for a pulpit to preach his \"Church Without Christ.\" As in O'Connor's subsequent work, the characters in this novel are driven to violence, even murder, and their strong vernacular endows them with the discomforting reality of next-door neighbors. \"In order to recognize a freak,\" she remarks in one of her essays, \"you have to have a conception of the whole man.\"In the title story of her first, dazzling collection of stories, A Good Man Is Hard to Find (1955), the old grandmother discovers the comic irrelevance of good manners when she and her family meet up with the sinister Misfit, who claims there is \"no pleasure but meanness.\" The terror of urban dislocation in \"The Artificial Nigger,\" the bizarre baptism in \"The River,\" or one-legged Hulga Hopewell's encounter with a Bible salesman in \"Good Country People\"--these startling events give readers the uneasy sense of mysteries about to be revealed.Her second novel, The Violent Bear It Away (1960), casts the shadow of the Old Testament across a landscape of backwoods shacks, modern towns, and empty highways. Caught between the prophetic fury of his great-uncle and the unrelenting rationalism of his uncle, fourteen-year-old Francis Tarwater undergoes a terrifying trial of faith when he is commanded to baptize his idiot cousin.The nine stories in Everything That Rises Must Converge (1965) show O'Connor's powers at their height.

Seniors are scrambling to finish their theses. And two students, Tom Sullivan and Paul Harris, are a hair's breadth from solving the mysteries of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili--a renowned text attributed to an Italian nobleman, a work that has baffled scholars since its publication in 1499. For Tom, their research has been a link to his family's past -- and an obstacle to the woman he loves. For Paul, it has become an obsession, the very reason for living. But as their deadline looms, research has stalled -- until a long-lost diary surfaces with a vital clue. And when a fellow researcher is murdered just hours later, Tom and Paul realize that they are not the first to glimpse the Hypnerotomachia 's secrets.Suddenly the stakes are raised, and as the two friends sift through the codes and riddles at the heart of the text, they are beginnning to see the manuscript in a new light--not simply as a story of faith, eroticism and pedantry, but as a bizarre, coded mathematical maze. And as they come closer and closer to deciphering the final puzzle of a book that has shattered careers, friendships and families, they know that their own lives are in mortal danger. Because at least one person has been killed for knowing too much.

In this dramatic first-person narrative, Greg Mortenson picks up where Three Cups of Tea left off in 2003, recounting his relentless, ongoing efforts to establish schools for girls in Afghanistan; his extensive work in Azad Kashmir and Pakistan after a massive earthquake hit the region in 2005; and the unique ways he has built relationships with Islamic clerics, militia commanders, and tribal leaders. He shares for the first time his broader vision to promote peace through education and literacy, as well as touching on military matters, Islam, and women-all woven together with the many rich personal stories of the people who have been involved in this remarkable two-decade humanitarian effort.  Since the 2006 publication of Three Cups of Tea, Mortenson has traveled across the U.S. and the world to share his vision with hundreds of thousands of people. He has met with heads of state, top military officials, and leading politicians who all seek his advice and insight. The continued phenomenal success of Three Cups of Tea proves that there is an eager and committed audience for Mortenson's work and message.\n", "genres": ["Education", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Cultural", "Adult", "Memoir", "Nonfiction", "Travel", "Asia", "History", "Inspirational", "Pakistan"]}, "96642": {"bookid": "96642", "title": "Rocket Boys", "author": "Homer Hickam", "series": "(Coalwood #1)", "ratings": "20294", "reviews": "2008", "rating": "4.15", "description": "\"Until I began to build and launch rockets, I didn't know my home town was at war with itself over its children, and that my parents were locked in a kind of bloodless combat over how my brother and I would live our lives.

And I didn't know that the enthalpy decrease in a converging passage could be transformed into jet kinetic energy if a divergent passage was added. The other boys discovered their own truths when we built our rockets, but those were mine.\"So begins Homer \"Sonny\" Hickam Jr.'s extraordinary memoir of life in Coalwood, West Virginia - a hard-scrabble little mining company town where the only things that mattered were coal mining and high school football and where the future was regarded with more fear than hope. Looking back after a distinguished NASA career, Hickam shares the story of his youth, taking readers into the life of the little mining town of Coalwood and the boys who would come to embody its dreams. In 1957 a young man watched the Soviet satellite Sputnik shoot across the Appalachian sky and soon found his future in the stars. 'Sonny' and a handful of his friends, Roy Lee Cook, Sherman O'Dell and Quentin Wilson were inspired to start designing and launching the home-made rockets that would change their lives forever.Step by step, with the help (and occasional hindrance) of a collection of unforgettable characters, the boys learn not only how to turn scrap into sophisticated rockets that fly miles into the sky, but how to sustain their dreams as they dared to imagine a life beyond its borders in a town that the postwar boom was passing by.A powerful story of growing up and of getting out, of a mother's love and a father's fears, Homer Hickam's memoir Rocket Boys proves, like Angela's Ashes and Russell Baker's Growing Up before it, that the right storyteller and the right story can touch readers' hearts and enchant their souls.A uniquely endearing book with universal themes of class, family, coming of age, and the thrill of discovery, Homer Hickam's Rocket Boys is evocative, vivid storytelling at its most magical.In 1999, Rocket Boys was made into a Hollywood movie named October Sky starring Chris Cooper, Jake Gyllenhaal and Laura Dern. October Sky is an anagram of Rocket Boys. It is also used in a period radio broadcast describing Sputnik 1 as it crossed the 'October sky'. Homer Hickam stated that \"Universal Studios marketing people got involved and they just had to change the title because, according to their research, women over thirty would never see a movie titled Rocket Boys\" so Universal Pictures changed the title to be more inviting to a wider audience. The book was later re-released with the name October Sky in order to capitalize on interest in the movie.\n", "genres": ["Biography", "School", "Autobiography", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "Science", "Academic", "Nonfiction", "History", "Space", "Historical"]}, "17162": {"bookid": "17162", "title": "The Chocolate War", "author": "Robert Cormier", "series": "(Chocolate War #1)", "ratings": "43994", "reviews": "3276", "rating": "3.50", "description": "Jerry Renault ponders the question on the poster in his locker: Do I dare disturb the universe?

Whether hunting warlords in Japan, druglords in Colombia, or nuclear terrorists in the United States, Clark is efficient and deadly, but even he has ghosts in his past, demons that must be exorcised. And nothing is more demonic than the peril he must face in Rainbow Six.Newly named the head of an international task force dedicated to combating terrorism, Clark is looking forward to getting his teeth into a new mission, but the opportunities start coming thicker and faster than anyone could have expected: an incident at a Swiss bank, the kidnapping of an international trader in Germany, a terrible raid on an amusement park in Spain.Each episode seems separate, discrete, yet the timing disturbs Clark. Is there a connection? Is he being tested? With the help of his close associates, executive officer Alistair Stanley and strike team leaders Domingo Chavez and Peter Covington, Clark tries to figure out where all this activity is heading, but there is no way to predict the real threat: a group of terrorists like none the world has ever encountered, a band of men and women so extreme that their success could literally mean the end of life on Earth as we know it.\n", "genres": ["War", "Mystery", "Military Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Fiction", "Action", "Thriller", "Spy Thriller", "Espionage", "Adventure", "Suspense"]}, "26077060": {"bookid": "26077060", "title": "Beautiful Affliction", "author": "Lene Fogelberg", "series": "", "ratings": "1901", "reviews": "143", "rating": "3.79", "description": "A young woman risks everything to save her own life in this \u201cunusual, riveting medical drama crafted with deep emotion and exquisite detail\u201d (BookPage).Lene Fogelberg is dying\u2014she is sure of it\u2014but no doctor in Sweden, her home country, believes her.

He had learned how to eat, cook and profit from some of the finest and richest foods in the world and he used those gifts with enormous enthusiasm and good humor.Suddenly everything changed as an accident severed his success with one blow.Searching for a return to resilience for himself and his family he began an ocean sailing adventure that took them 24,000 miles in 2 years.Then follows one of the most observed U turns ever made by one man. The Kerr's went from a conspicuous gourmet lifestyle to that of a small family living their lives beyond immediate self-interest and they did this in plain sight!Graham uses the literary practice of the 'extended metaphor' to enquire how habits are both formed and relinquished. He does this by comparing his life with that of a wild pacific Chinook salmon. Using poetic license, imagination and good science he asks his readers to hear from the salmon...direct and to see how both man and fish have somewhat similar rites of passage.They are swept 'downstream' where they face continuous discovery, some of which are difficult, some joyful...even hilarious.Upon reaching the salt waters they encounter the challenge of an almost limitless 'ocean of opportunity' where they must eat or be eaten, always driven by immediate self-interest and the need to survive.Finally they turn away from conspicuous consumption and begin to go 'upstream on purpose', this time motivated not just to survive as individuals, but also as a species...It's a wild ride as the scent of their natal river begins to provide direction for their way back home, where it all began.Kerr is not an angry activist, as he puts it.\"I have a story to tell and it's personal.

Where a person that would labeled as intellectually gifted on Earth is nothing more than average there. A place where the average person is even more powerful than your typical super hero. A place several times more vast and mysterious than earth . and home to over 50 non hybrid races. Just Imagine how far they would have advanced in the time that we have had. Then imagine how far they would have advanced given 10, 100, or even 1000 times longer than we had. Do you imagine large skyscrapers and flying cars as in your common sci fi flicks and novels. Well, they've advanced far past that even. What would their super heroes be like, and the villains that they have to combine forces to fight against. And how would the planet survive the battles between these people. Not to mention what would every day life be like? And with their powers would they feel as gods themselves and not have need to reverence them? In fact the heroes held a contest and after beating many Shenxian, kami, Orishas, and Immortals they believed they were indeed powerful enough to at least compete with the gods. They challenged the supreme gods and the realm gods. After loosing horribly they incurred the supreme goddess' wrath as punishment. However she was not satisfied with just punishing them, as she wanted to destroy them completely. However the supreme god felt that their punishment was enough and that they should be forgiven. Unable to agree they decided to settle it the way gods do. They made bet which would decide whether they would perish or thrive. Six beings would be created, beings much more powerful than any that have ever been created. Two beings would be of light, two would be of darkness, and two neutral ones that would pick a side. The gods would set up challenges for them along the way to train them until the day of the final contest. When that day comes they would fight each other to the death and if light won they would be saved, however if dark won they would all die. Which one would prevail light or darkness? Sounds like your typical fantasy novel right? However what if when they are born they decide not to be pawns in the god's game? Can and will they defy their destiny even when all their moves are being controlled leading them to that end? And if they do defy the gods what will be the retribution for their actions,... and more importantly how will they respond to it? This story follows the lives of the 6 beings. The children of Darkness  Titan- (master of dimensions, souls, energy, and matter/anti matter) Nina- (Master of psyche, various elements and forces, space, and the dead) The children of Light  Emerald- (elemental master, spirit and sentient, energy, matter and fusion) Sapphire (Master of copying and reversing, Time, and various elements)  The neutral children  Rage (master of reality, mystic, and various elements.) Dragon (master of magic, various elements, and death) This story has hundreds of characters all with their own goals and interest. Full of unexpected plot twists and turns that will keep you guessing at each turn of the page. Volume 1 deals with the introduction of the main characters but is by no means slow paced. It pulls you right into the ever evolving and expanding world. Filled with action, romance, comedy, and philosophy that will have you rethink everything.

Get access to the wisdom and determination, that made the Renaissance possible, using the Mantegna Tarot as compass. This hands-on book presents actionable ways to use the Mantegna Tarot as a tool of personal growth, to flourish for the benefit of all beings by tapping into the creative sparkles of the Italian Renaissance. It is not an academic treatise about tarots, nor about the mesmerizing history of the Renaissance. It explains how to use the Mantegna Tarot to gain more insights about the Four Spheres of life: behavior, emotions, cognition, meaning. When these spheres are in harmony, you live a meaningful life that expresses its full potential for the benefit of all. When the Four Spheres are not in synch, problems arise. Each of the first four chapters of this book, analyzes the Mantegna Tarot cards for the corresponding sphere. The remaining chapters explains how to use the cards, integrating them into your daily life. You do not need to buy a Mantegna Tarot deck to use this book. These engravings are printed inside the book, on regular pages. If you like, you can cut them out, glue them to cardboard, and cut out each card. Back-pages were intentionally left blank, to ensure cards can be cut without affecting the text of the book.

He also highlights the pitfalls of many of our culture's poor spending habits, even though they've become accepted practices in today's world. \"It makes no sense that someone would volunteer to be a slave, but that's exactly what's happening in the United States today,\" says Rabbi Celso. \"Far too many people are signing up to become slaves to their credit card companies.\" Secrets of Jewish Wealth Revealed! is a program of simple, but essential steps that Rabbi Celso believes will forever change the way people look at their finances, and handle their money. He discloses the eternal truths behind the oldest financial system in history, the one that has survived the test of time: the Jewish approach to financial management. \n", "genres": ["Economics", "Finance", "Jewish", "Money", "Literature", "Currency", "Nonfiction"]}, "19668": {"bookid": "19668", "title": "Without Remorse", "author": "Tom Clancy", "series": "(Jack Ryan Universe #1)", "ratings": "66851", "reviews": "1606", "rating": "4.19", "description": "John Kelly, former Navy SEAL and Vietnam veteran, is still getting over the accidental death of his wife six months before, when he befriends a young woman with a decidedly checkered past.

Written in 1936 and published the following year, this brilliant and profound evaluation of Stalinism from the Marxist standpoint prophesied the collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent related events.The effects of the October Revolution led to the establishment of a nationalized planned economy, demonstrating the practicality of socialism for the first time. By the 1930s, however, the Soviet workers' democracy had crumbled into a state of bureaucratic decay that ultimately gave rise to an infamous totalitarian regime.

This groundbreaking book by the most influential philosopher since Sartre compels us to reevaluate our assumptions about all the ensuing reforms in the penal institutions of the West. For as he examines innovations that range from the abolition of torture to the institution of forced labor and the appearance of the modern penitentiary, Michel Foucault suggests that punishment has shifted its focus from the prisoner's body to the soul \u2014 and that our very concern with rehabilitation encourages and refines criminal activity.Lucidly reasoned and deftly marshaling a vast body of research, Discipline and Punish is a genuinely revolutionary book, whose implications extend beyond the prison to the minute power relations of our society.\n", "genres": ["Sociology", "Cultural", "Anthropology", "Law", "Psychology", "School", "Academic", "France", "History", "Social Science", "Philosophy"]}, "6345416": {"bookid": "6345416", "title": "The Wide Game", "author": "Michael  West", "series": "(Harmony, Indiana #1)", "ratings": "205", "reviews": "34", "rating": "3.86", "description": "On the advice of his wife, Paul Rice is making plans to attend his 10th year high school reunion.

One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but. As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives -- a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys -- she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell. With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.Maybe You Should Talk to Someone is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them.\n", "genres": ["Biography", "Autobiography", "Biography Memoir", "Psychology", "Adult", "Memoir", "Health", "Personal Development", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook", "Self Help", "Mental Health"]}, "769658": {"bookid": "769658", "title": "Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000", "author": "L.

They're also proof that the Lord does work in mysterious ways -- extending all the way to squares of LSD and nitrous oxide cartridges.Armed with psychedelics, hallucinogenics and a brave desire to meet God no matter the personal cost, Stephen pushed beyond the boundaries of safe drug use. He took the most nightmarish of trips from a cramped one-bedroom apartment that he used for running his underground video business. With initial difficulty finding God in his altered state, Stephen instead encountered depravity and grotesquery enough to make his soul weep, but he pushed on.

That is until 1985 when her father moved the family from the Highlands of Scotland to the Midlands of Wales. It is there she was enrolled in Bennington, a private boarding school, met the charming and rebellious Dickinson twins, Oliver and Alexander, and her regrettable life was changed forever. Locked into a fierce friendship with Alexander and lost to a whirlwind romance with Oliver, Silvia found herself torn away from everything she thought she knew. Married too soon, she moved with Oliver to a rustic cabin deep in a Welsh wood and embarked upon a life she'd never planned for, surviving on hope she never knew existed and faith she never knew she had. She made her way through university and onto a career, only to surrender her ambition to raising her children and living a life that was strikingly \"normal\". But what is normal? Certainly not what ensued in the wood.True love, faeries, friendship, loves lost and gained. Old magic, fate, doubt, strength and courage, Silvia's story could belong to anyone, but it is her own. Simple yet extraordinary, told in retrospect with wit and candor, Silvia recalls a life of joy and sorrow, laughter and tears. As she unravels the tangled web of her days, she reveals the secrets that exist in an ancient wood, how hearts given freely can become the stuff of magic, and how true happiness was never any further than her own back garden.\n", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Coming Of Age", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary", "Chick Lit", "Contemporary Romance", "Young Adult"]}, "19395125": {"bookid": "19395125", "title": "The Vanishing Girl", "author": "Laura Thalassa", "series": "(The Vanishing Girl #1)", "ratings": "5941", "reviews": "509", "rating": "3.86", "description": "Every night after Ember Pierce falls asleep, she disappears.

What she does know is that 'difference' had currency in the past, and it certainly still has currency today. The Sabi will have an effect on you - have no doubt about that. In her debut novel, Diane Brown takes a scenic and open-eyed walk down memory lane to the 1960's when apartheid was in full swing to the early 1990's when South Africa was beginning to sense freedom. She ventures further back in time to help solve the puzzle of the current time, how did South Africa become so angry and so violent? Writing from the heart to relate the events of her childhood and adolescence, the author takes you on a journey that will make you cry and laugh along with her as she tried to make sense of her life, the people around her and the system into which she was born. She is no doubt left extremely vulnerable and exposed in relating this account of her life. This honesty is anchored in an easy writing style which is deeply reflective, with an acute sense of contextual reasoning. She reflects on the news of the day in a 'free' country, tainted with the heavy stench of death, violence and abuse and notes that all too familiar script. She finally realises...

They range from a transsexual crack dealer in Brooklyn searching for her mother to a teenage hit-man in Mexico searching for a way out.

Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker\u2014a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry's brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father's money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma's research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction \u2014 into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist \u2014 but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life.Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globe\u2014from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who \u2014 born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution \u2014 bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas. Written in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time, Gilbert's wise, deep, and spellbinding tale is certain to capture the hearts and minds of readers.\n", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Environment", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Nature", "Historical Fiction", "Novels", "Fiction", "Book Club", "Audiobook", "Historical"]}, "38339351": {"bookid": "38339351", "title": "PARADOX: Super Indy", "author": "Alex Letner", "series": "(Super Indy)", "ratings": "41", "reviews": "2", "rating": "4.76", "description": "Comic book.

Written with acute observation, Cranford is by turns affectionate, moving and darkly satirical.In her introduction, Patricia Ingham discusses Cranford in relation to Gaskell's own past and as a work of irony in the manner of Jane Austen.

Part Three Cups of Tea, and part Into Thin Air, Grennan's remarkable memoir is at once gripping and inspirational, and it carries us deep into an exotic world that most readers know little about.One Person Can Make a DifferenceIn search of adventure, twenty-nine-year-old Conor Grennan traded his day job for a year-long trip around the globe, a journey that began with a three-month stint volunteering at the Little Princes Children's Home, an orphanage in war-torn Nepal. Conor was initially reluctant to volunteer, unsure whether he had the proper skill, or enough passion, to get involved in a developing country in the middle of a civil war. But he was soon overcome by the herd of rambunctious, resilient children who would challenge and reward him in a way that he had never imagined. When Conor learned the unthinkable truth about their situation, he was stunned: The children were not orphans at all. Child traffickers were promising families in remote villages to protect their children from the civil war - for a huge fee - by taking them to safety. They would then abandon the children far from home, in the chaos of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. For Conor, what began as a footloose adventure becomes a commitment to reunite the children he had grown to love with their families, but this would be no small task. He would risk his life on a journey through the legendary mountains of Nepal, facing the dangers of a bloody civil war and a debilitating injury. Waiting for Conor back in Kathmandu, and hopeful he would make it out before being trapped in by snow, was the woman who would eventually become his wife and share his life's work. Little Princes is a true story of families and children, and what one person is capable of when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. At turns tragic, joyful, and hilarious, Little Princes is a testament to the power of faith and the ability of love to carry us beyond our wildest expectations.\n", "genres": ["Biography", "Autobiography", "Cultural", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "Nonfiction", "Travel", "Asia", "Audiobook", "Adventure", "Inspirational"]}, "17605380": {"bookid": "17605380", "title": "Seeing Karma (Valentine/Petrilo #5)", "author": "Reyna Hawk", "series": "", "ratings": "22", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.55", "description": "Over 20 years has passed since Janie walked away from Malachi and returned to a life with Rico.

The Caucasian Chalk Circle is a parable inspired by the Chinese play Chalk Circle. Written at the close of World War II, the story is set in the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia. It retells the tale of King Solomon and a child claimed by and fought over by two mothers. But this chalk circle is metaphorically drawn around a society misdirected in its priorities.

Air & Fire is about a group of French people sent to California at the end of the 19th century to build a church. The Insult is about a man blinded by a robber in a supermarket parking lot who discovers one night that--because of a bizarre experiment--he can see again. Thomson's latest finds three very different characters--an aimless waitress, a reluctant hit man, and an ambitious young marketing executive--linked by the sudden success of a new soft drink. But a closer look confirms the feeling that Soft! continues the author's fascination with the way science can bend and shape the destinies of all sorts of nonscientific people. Certainly Glade Spencer, the flaky young woman who flies off periodically for unpleasant encounters with her American lawyer boyfriend, has no idea when she signs up for a sleep clinic to earn some extra cash that the soda slogans planted in her brain could cause her death. Barker Dodds, the nightclub bouncer from Plymouth, doesn't know why he's being paid to kill Glade. And James Lyle, the striving marketer who thought up the brainwashing scheme in the first place, is deliberately out of the loop about its consequences. All three are so perfectly drawn that you'd recognize them on the street, and the way Thomson describes their quirky, weirdly decorated flats and lifestyles captures the flickering pulse of London with uncanny accuracy. --Dick Adler\n", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Noir", "Mystery", "Adult Fiction", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Novels", "Fiction", "Contemporary", "Crime", "Suspense"]}, "50905836": {"bookid": "50905836", "title": "From Brexit to Brazil", "author": "John Richard Spencer", "series": "", "ratings": "303", "reviews": "9", "rating": "4.26", "description": "An insightful foray into the colourful volatility of today\u2019s world this collection of prosaic essays remarks on the political, social, lifestyle and environmental maelstrom in which we find ourselves.

When that first book of letters appeared in 1997, Time pronounced it \"deliriously entertaining\"; Rolling Stone called it \"brilliant beyond description\"; and The New York Times celebrated its \"wicked humor and bracing political conviction.\"Spanning the years between 1968 and 1976, these never-before-published letters show Thompson building his legend: running for sheriff in Aspen, Colorado; creating the seminal road book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas; twisting political reporting to new heights for Rolling Stone; and making sense of it all in the landmark Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. To read Thompson's dispatches from these years--addressed to the author's friends, enemies, editors, and creditors, and such notables as Jimmy Carter, Tom Wolfe, and Kurt Vonnegut--is to read a raw, revolutionary eyewitness account of one of the most exciting and pivotal eras in American history.\n", "genres": ["Journalism", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Biography Memoir", "Politics", "Memoir", "Essays", "Unfinished", "Literature", "Nonfiction", "History", "Writing"]}, "4008": {"bookid": "4008", "title": "The Devil and Miss Prym", "author": "Paulo Coelho", "series": "(On the Seventh Day  #3)", "ratings": "65297", "reviews": "3202", "rating": "3.61", "description": "A stranger arrives at the remote village of Viscos, carrying with him a backpack containing a notebook and eleven gold bars.

Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.\n", "genres": ["War", "World War II", "Holocaust", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Romance", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Historical"]}, "602657": {"bookid": "602657", "title": "\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0645\u0631\u063a \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc", "author": "Richard Bach", "series": "", "ratings": "226994", "reviews": "9289", "rating": "3.85", "description": "\u0631\u06cc\u0686\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0627\u062e \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 1970 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u060c \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u063a \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u062f \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0628\u0642\u06cc\u0647 \u06cc \u0645\u0631\u063a\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0645\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u062f \u062a\u0646\u062f\u062a\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0631 \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0646\u062f. \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u062a\u063a\u06cc\u06cc\u0631 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0645\u0639 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0645\u06cc \u0631\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f. \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u060c \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06cc\u0627 \u0645\u0631\u063a\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u0631\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646\u062f\u061f \u0633\u0631\u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u063a \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u0646\u062f \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0632\u060c \u0646\u0632\u062f\u06cc\u06a9 \u0686\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0627 \u0646\u0641\u0631 \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0633\u062d\u0648\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0631", "genres": ["Fantasy", "Classics", "Spirituality", "Novels", "Fiction", "Literature", "Animals", "Self Help", "Inspirational", "Philosophy"]}, "44242501": {"bookid": "44242501", "title": "The Transhumanism Handbook", "author": "Newton Lee", "series": "", "ratings": "347", "reviews": "9", "rating": "4.26", "description": "Modern humanity with some 5,000 years of recorded history has been experiencing growing pains, with no end in sight.

Ken Follett takes us deep into the treacherous world of powerful monarchs, intrigue, murder, and treason with his magnificent epic, A Column of Fire\u2014the chronological latest in the Kingsbridge series, following The Pillars of the Earth, World Without End, and the prequel, The Evening and the Morning.In 1558, the ancient stones of Kingsbridge Cathedral look down on a city torn apart by religious conflict. As power in England shifts precariously between Catholics and Protestants, royalty and commoners clash, testing friendship, loyalty, and love.  Ned Willard wants nothing more than to marry Margery Fitzgerald. But when the lovers find themselves on opposing sides of the religious conflict dividing the country, Ned goes to work for Princess Elizabeth. When she becomes queen, all Europe turns against England. The shrewd, determined young monarch sets up the country\u2019s first secret service to give her early warning of assassination plots, rebellions, and invasion plans. Over a turbulent half century, the love between Ned and Margery seems doomed as extremism sparks violence from Edinburgh to Geneva. Elizabeth clings to her throne and her principles, protected by a small, dedicated group of resourceful spies and courageous secret agents. The real enemies, then as now, are not the rival religions. The true battle pitches those who believe in tolerance and compromise against the tyrants who would impose their ideas on everyone else\u2014no matter what the cost. Exciting and ambitious, and set during one of the most turbulent and revolutionary times in history, A Column of Fire will delight longtime fans of the Kingsbridge series and serve as the perfect introduction for readers new to Ken Follett.\n", "genres": ["Religion", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Fantasy", "Adult", "Romance", "Historical Fiction", "Novels", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Historical"]}, "51737": {"bookid": "51737", "title": "The Truth About Forever", "author": "Sarah Dessen", "series": "", "ratings": "217354", "reviews": "8599", "rating": "4.12", "description": "That's what Macy has to look forward to while her boyfriend, Jason, is away at Brain Camp.

Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: \"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\" Eker does this by identifying your \"money and success blueprint.\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money\u2014and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"revise\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \"Wealth Files,\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!\n", "genres": ["Economics", "Finance", "Personal Finance", "Business", "Psychology", "Money", "Entrepreneurship", "Personal Development", "Nonfiction", "Currency", "Self Help", "Audiobook"]}, "30288282": {"bookid": "30288282", "title": "The Immortalists", "author": "Chloe  Benjamin", "series": "", "ratings": "180664", "reviews": "17959", "rating": "3.71", "description": "If you knew the date of your death, how would you live your life?It's 1969 in New York City's Lower East Side, and word has spread of the arrival of a mystical woman, a traveling psychic who claims to be able to tell anyone the day they will die.

The End of Faith. The God Delusion. God Is Not Great. Letter to a Christian Nation. Bestseller lists are filled with doubters. But what happens when you actually doubt your doubts?Although a vocal minority continues to attack the Christian faith, for most Americans, faith is a large part of their lives: 86 percent of Americans refer to themselves as religious, and 75 percent of all Americans consider themselves Christians. So how should they respond to these passionate, learned, and persuasive books that promote science and secularism over religion and faith? For years, Tim Keller has compiled a list of the most frequently voiced \u201cdoubts\u201d skeptics bring to his Manhattan church. And in The Reason for God, he single-handedly dismantles each of them. Written with atheists, agnostics, and skeptics in mind, Keller also provides an intelligent platform on which true believers can stand their ground when bombarded by the backlash. The Reason for God challenges such ideology at its core and points to the true path and purpose of Christianity.Why is there suffering in the world? How could a loving God send people to Hell? Why isn\u2019t Christianity more inclusive? Shouldn\u2019t the Christian God be a god of love? How can one religion be \u201cright\u201d and the rest \u201cwrong\u201d? Why have so many wars been fought in the name of God? These are just a few of the questions even ardent believers wrestle with today. In this book, Tim Keller uses literature, philosophy, real-life conversations and reasoning, and even pop culture to explain how faith in a Christian God is a soundly rational belief, held by thoughtful people of intellectual integrity with a deep compassion for those who truly want to know the truth.\n", "genres": ["Christian", "Christian Living", "Religion", "Theology", "Spirituality", "Nonfiction", "Christianity", "Christian Non Fiction", "Faith", "Philosophy"]}, "15699321": {"bookid": "15699321", "title": "The Warrior's Way", "author": "Zoe Saadia", "series": "(Pre-Aztec #3)", "ratings": "103", "reviews": "12", "rating": "4.51", "description": "The small Aztecs island is busy trying to gain their independence, while helping the Tepanecs expand their Empire, engaging in more and more wars.Yet, the Great Empire's interests are not always going along with our heroes' goals.

To all Mindfulness and Alchemy Explorers who see the beauty in every-day Nature & Universal sacred language of symbols and signs. We will not talk about spiritual symbols worshiped by major religions but about trees, numbers, spirals that we meet daily. Through symbols to mindfulness meditations. Symbols and signs are the languages of the soul. Symbols and signs are the language of dreams. Occultists believe that signs and symbols are given a supernatural power at their creation. Words, signs and symbols, images, colors, light, are all used for eons to convey a spiritual meaning. The Mystics of India In ancient India yogis observed the world as an illusion. Yet, the magic of the spiritual world stayed deeply connected to the sense world. Within the science of yoga, the way we treat our spine influences our health and well-being, the way we treat our thoughts, or the practice of meditation influences our current incarnation. The Mystics of Greece For the philosophers of ancient Babylonia and Greece the sense world was not considered an illusion. In the search for Divine, they turned towards art, towards symbols and signs within myths and legends. In mysterious ways the wisdom of the initiates poured into poets, artists, and thinkers. Manipulating the elements, they turned towards the Lady Science and carried her principles to the point that we are now able to manipulate the sound, the light, the matter and its manifestation. The Mystics of China Chinese created I Ching that within its symbolism reflects the universe in miniature. The book is at the heart of Confucian thought and Taoism, but also a common tool among the fortune tellers that use it as a divination text and a roadside oracle. The Mystics of Kabbalah Kabbalists designed the Tree of Life and the Tarot symbolism followed it. Kabbalah is an esoteric teaching, a science that explores metaphysical principles of the universe. Any material object and action from both the micro and the macro world is controlled by the spiritual forces. Kabbalah attempts to understand these spiritual sources, to know their nature and properties. Mystics Magic and God To a Chinese sage, a Yogi, and a Cabbalist Mystic, the earth is a field of activity that has to be transformed, so that it carries an imprint of human will. The Mystics, the Magi initiates, the guardians of the oracle mysteries acquired deep knowledge of the laws of the spiritual world and their interaction with the sense world. Some of them worked hard all through their lives to decipher the spiritual forces behind the forces of nature and to learn how to control the elements. Just as God is hidden, so are the inner secrets of Her divine message. We read about them, hear them uttered, but we cannot possibly comprehend their meaning unless we have a direct experience of their truth. That is why to be able to talk to our souls we use meditation, we use rituals, symbols and signs, we use dreams and careful observation of souls\u2019 subconscious messages. The mystics of our past help us in this quest. From Zarathustra who comes from the ancient Persian spiritual culture, to Pythagoras who comes from the Greco-Latin cultural epoch, to Lao Tzu, Buddha and Christ, they all carry the keys to the secrets of the most varied mysteries. In March 2015, Artof4Elements developed and launched the Alchemy of Love Mindfulness Training Series of 9 fiction and non-fiction books with 7 authors focusing on spiritual growth, creativity and mindfulness. A series of many genre's, including poetry, personal development, historical fiction, the world of Alchemy of Love Mindfulness Training explores numerous self development themes.

In The Poisoner's Handbook Blum draws from highly original research to track the fascinating, perilous days when a pair of forensic scientists began their trailblazing chemical detective work, fighting to end an era when untraceable poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime.  Drama unfolds case by case as the heroes of The Poisoner's Handbook\u2014chief medical examiner Charles Norris and toxicologist Alexander Gettler\u2014investigate a family mysteriously stricken bald, Barnum and Bailey's Famous Blue Man, factory workers with crumbling bones, a diner serving poisoned pies, and many others. Each case presents a deadly new puzzle and Norris and Gettler work with a creativity that rivals that of the most imaginative murderer, creating revolutionary experiments to tease out even the wiliest compounds from human tissue. Yet in the tricky game of toxins, even science can't always be trusted, as proven when one of Gettler's experiments erroneously sets free a suburban housewife later nicknamed \"America's Lucretia Borgia\" to continue her nefarious work.  From the vantage of Norris and Gettler's laboratory in the infamous Bellevue Hospital it becomes clear that killers aren't the only toxic threat to New Yorkers. Modern life has created a kind of poison playground, and danger lurks around every corner. Automobiles choke the city streets with carbon monoxide; potent compounds, such as morphine, can be found on store shelves in products ranging from pesticides to cosmetics. Prohibition incites a chemist's war between bootleggers and government chemists while in Gotham's crowded speakeasies each round of cocktails becomes a game of Russian roulette. Norris and Gettler triumph over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice during a remarkably deadly time. A beguiling concoction that is equal parts true crime, twentieth-century history, and science thriller, The Poisoner's Handbook is a page-turning account of a forgotten New York.\n", "genres": ["Medical", "True Crime", "Mystery", "Medicine", "Science", "Health", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook", "Crime", "History", "Historical"]}, "900": {"bookid": "900", "title": "The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists", "author": "Neil Strauss", "series": "", "ratings": "28535", "reviews": "2051", "rating": "3.73", "description": "Hidden somewhere, in nearly every major city in the world, is an underground seduction lair.

Not only is the clich\u00e9 flawed\u2014preexisting passions are rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work\u2014but it can also be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping.After making his case against passion, Newport sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving what they do. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers.Matching your job to a preexisting passion does not matter, he reveals. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it.With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to \"be so good they can't ignore you,\" Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love.So Good They Can't Ignore You will change the way we think about our careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.\n", "genres": ["Education", "Productivity", "Business", "Psychology", "Personal Development", "Leadership", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook", "Self Help", "Philosophy"]}, "327548": {"bookid": "327548", "title": "The Walking Drum", "author": "Louis L'Amour", "series": "", "ratings": "8433", "reviews": "772", "rating": "4.24", "description": "Louis L'Amour has been best known for his ability to capture the spirit and drama of the authentic American West.

Addiction, perfectionism, fear and blame are just a few of the outward signs that Dr. Bren\u00e9 Brown discovered in her 6-year study of shame\u2019s effects on women. While shame is generally thought of as an emotion sequestered in the shadows of our psyches, I Thought It Was Just Me demonstrates the ways in which it is actually present in the most mundane and visible aspects of our lives\u2014from our mental and physical health and body image to our relationships with our partners, our kids, our friends, our money, and our work. After talking to hundreds of women and therapists, Dr. Brown is able to illuminate the myriad shaming influences that dominate our culture and explain why we are all vulnerable to shame. We live in a culture that tells us we must reject our bodies, reject our authentic stories, and ultimately reject our true selves in order to fit in and be accepted.Outlining an empowering new approach that dispels judgment and awakens us to the genuine acceptance of ourselves and others, I Thought It Was Just Me begins a crucial new dialogue of hope. Through potent personal narratives and examples from real women, Brown identifies and explains four key elements that allow women to transform their shame into courage, compassion and connection. Shame is a dark and sad place in which to live a life, keeping us from connecting fully to our loved ones and being the women we were meant to be. But learning how to understand shame\u2019s influence and move through it toward full acceptance of ourselves and others takes away much of shame\u2019s power to harm.It\u2019s not just you, you\u2019re not alone, and if you fight the daily battle of feeling like you are\u2014somehow\u2014just not \"enough,\" you owe it to yourself to read this book and discover your infinite possibilities as a human being.\n", "genres": ["Feminism", "Psychology", "Relationships", "Womens", "Health", "Personal Development", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook", "Self Help", "Mental Health"]}, "295132": {"bookid": "295132", "title": "Care of the Soul: A Guide for Cultivating Depth and Sacredness in Everyday Life", "author": "Thomas  Moore", "series": "", "ratings": "17576", "reviews": "456", "rating": "3.95", "description": "This New York Times bestseller (more than 200,000 hardcover copies sold) provides a path-breaking lifestyle handbook that shows how to add spirituality, depth, and meaning to modern-day life by nurturing the soul.Readers are presented with a revolutionary approach to thinking about daily life\u2014everyday activities, events, problems and creative opportunities\u2014and a therapeuti\nThis New York Times bestseller (more than 200,000 hardcover copies sold) provides a path-breaking lifestyle handbook that shows how to add spirituality, depth, and meaning to modern-day life by nurturing the soul.Readers are presented with a revolutionary approach to thinking about daily life\u2014everyday activities, events, problems and creative opportunities\u2014and a therapeutic lifestyle is proposed that focuses on looking more deeply into emotional problems and learning how to sense sacredness in even ordinary things.Basing his writing on the ancient model of \"care of the soul\"\u2014which provided a religious context for viewing the everyday events of life\u2014Moore brings \"care of the soul\" into the 21st century.

Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .\u201d Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work\u2014first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying. In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn\u2019t enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point. Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder. From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women\u2019s health issues. In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject.

But to make it a lucrative farming state, much of the land had to be deforested, leaving behind devastated habitats. The Limberlost, a wetland in northern Indiana, was mostly destroyed by drainage, logging and oil production. Gene Stratton-Porter, an early 20th-century naturalist and novelist, captured the fading beauty of the swamp in books like A Girl of the Limberlost, a novel about a smart, ambitious girl who lives in the dwindling wetland with her mother and pays for school by collecting local moth specimens to sell to naturalists. The book isn\u2019t exactly an environmentalist tract, but it makes the case nonetheless: It celebrates the beauty and richness of the swampland, while showing how easily economic forces push landowners to strip it away.\n", "genres": ["Childrens", "Coming Of Age", "Environment", "Classics", "Romance", "Nature", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Historical", "Young Adult", "Middle Grade"]}, "5402193": {"bookid": "5402193", "title": "Farm Sanctuary: Changing Hearts and Minds About Animals and Food", "author": "Gene Baur", "series": "", "ratings": "1384", "reviews": "135", "rating": "4.31", "description": "Leading animal rights activist Gene Baur examines the real cost of the meat on our plates -- for both humans and animals alike -- in this provocative and thorough examination of the modern farm industry.

Many people picture cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens as friendly creatures who live happily within the confines of a peaceful family farm, arriving as food for humans only at the end of their sun-drenched lives. That's what Gene Baur had been told -- but when he first visited a stockyard he realized that this rosy depiction couldn't be more inaccurate.  Amid the stench, noise, and filth, his attention was drawn in particular to one sheep who had been cast aside for dead. But as Baur walked by, the sheep raised her head and looked right at him. She was still alive, and the one thing Baur knew for sure that day was that he had to get her to safety. Hilda, as she was later named, was nursed back to health and soon became the first resident of Farm Sanctuary -- an organization dedicated to the rescue, care, and protection of farm animals.  The truth is that farm production does not depend on the family farmer with a small herd of animals but instead resembles a large, assembly-line factory. Animals raised for human consumption are confined for the entirety of their lives and often live without companionship, fresh air, or even adequate food and water.Viewed as production units rather than living beings with feelings, ten billion farm animals are exploited specifically for food in the United States every year.  In Farm Sanctuary, Baur provides a thoughtprovoking investigation of the ethical questions involved in the production of beef, poultry, pork, milk,and eggs -- and what each of us can do to stop the mistreatment of farm animals and promote compassion. He details the triumphs and the disappointments of more than twenty years on the front lines of the animal protection movement. And he introduces sanctuary. us to some of the special creatures who live at Farm Sanctuary -- from Maya the cow to Marmalade the chicken -- all of whom escaped horrible circumstances to live happier, more peaceful lives. Farm Sanctuary shows how all of us have an opportunity and a responsibility to consume a kinder plate, making a better life for ourselves and animals as well. You will certainly never think of a hamburger or chicken breast the same way after reading this book.\n", "genres": ["Social Issues", "Food", "Environment", "Nutrition", "Health", "Vegan", "Nonfiction", "Animals", "Vegetarian", "Vegetarianism", "Activism", "Food and Drink"]}, "414895": {"bookid": "414895", "title": "Planet of the Apes", "author": "Pierre Boulle", "series": "", "ratings": "36894", "reviews": "1805", "rating": "3.97", "description": "\"I am confiding this manuscript to space, not with the intention of saving myself, but to help, perhaps, to avert the appalling scourge that is menacing the human race.

Lord have pity on us!\"With these words, Pierre Boulle hurtles the reader onto the Planet of the Apes. In this simian world, civilization is turned upside down: apes are men and men are apes; apes rule and men run wild; apes think, speak, produce, wear clothes, and men are speechless, naked, exhibited at fairs, used for biological research. On the planet of the apes, man, having reached to apotheosis of his genius, has become inert.To this planet come a journalist and a scientist. The scientist is put into a zoo, the journalist into a laboratory. Only the journalist retains the spiritual strength and creative intelligence to try to save himself, to fight the appalling scourge, to remain a man.Out of this situation, Pierre Boulle has woven a tale as harrowing, bizarre, and meaningful as any in the brilliant roster of this master storyteller.

Following the prides and passions of a group of Jews, Romans and Barbarians living at the time of the siege, the narrative is centered on an ill-fated romance between a steadfast slave girl, Hadassah, and Marcus, the brother of her owner and a handsome aristocrat. After surviving the massacre of her family and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, Hadassah is captured and sold to a well-to-do merchant\u2019s family. Brought to Rome, she is pressed into service as a personal slave to hedonistic Julia Valerian. Hadassah struggles to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and to treat her masters in a manner in keeping with His teachings, but she is forced to keep her religious identity a secret in order to survive. Confused and alone, she has only her faith to cling to as she tries to subtly bring God into the lives of her captors. Reckless, impulsive, and villainous, Julia tries to undermine Hadassah at every turn. But Julia\u2019s brother, Marcus, is a different sort altogether. Is it possible for a love between Hadassah and Marcus to flourish considering not only their differing stations in life, but also the gap between Hadassah\u2019s unrelenting faith and Marcus\u2019 lack of belief in anything? Simultaneously, Atretes, a captured soldier from Germania, is forced to become a gladiator. This is the time of Rome\u2019s decline and the decadence of a civilization on the verge of self-destruction serves as a powerful backdrop to the Barbarian\u2019s struggle for survival in the arena.\n", "genres": ["Christian", "Historical Romance", "Religion", "Adult", "Romance", "Christian Romance", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Historical", "Christian Fiction"]}, "845977": {"bookid": "845977", "title": "A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of \"A Course in Miracles\"", "author": "Marianne Williamson", "series": "", "ratings": "31312", "reviews": "1195", "rating": "4.25", "description": "Back by popular demand -- and newly updated by the author -- the mega-bestselling spiritual guide in which Marianne Williamson shares her reflections on A Course in Miracles and her insights on the application of love in the search for inner peace.Williamson reveals how we each can become a miracle worker by accepting God and by the expression of love in our daily lives.

Jenny Offill's heroine, referred to in these pages as simply \"the wife,\" once exchanged love letters with her husband postmarked Dept. of Speculation, their code name for all the uncertainty that inheres in life and in the strangely fluid confines of a long relationship. As they confront an array of common catastrophes - a colicky baby, a faltering marriage, stalled ambitions - the wife analyzes her predicament, invoking everything from Keats and Kafka to the thought experiments of the Stoics to the lessons of doomed Russian cosmonauts. She muses on the consuming, capacious experience of maternal love, and the near total destruction of the self that ensues from it as she confronts the friction between domestic life and the seductions and demands of art.

Mindsight allows you to make positive changes in your brain-and in your life.- Is there a memory that torments you, or an irrational fear you can' t shake?- Do you sometimes become unreasonably angry or upset and find it hard to calm down?- Do you ever wonder why you can't stop behaving the way you do, no matter how hard you try?- Are you and your child (or parent, partner, or boss) locked in a seemingly inevitable pattern of conflict?What if you could escape traps like these and live a fuller, richer, happier life? This isn't mere speculation but the result of twenty-five years of careful hands-on clinical work by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. A Harvard-trained physician, Dr. Siegel is one of the revolutionary global innovators in the integration of brain science into the practice of psychotherapy. Using case histories from his practice, he shows how, by following the proper steps, nearly everyone can learn how to focus their attention on the internal world of the mind in a way that will literally change the wiring and architecture of their brain.Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients heal themselves from painful events in the past and liberate themselves from obstacles blocking their happiness in the present. And now he has written the first book that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes- a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional storms that made him suicidal- a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood accident, the source of her dread- a physician-the author himself-who pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a \"vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart and my gut,\" and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear infection- a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a meditation that is \"like watching myself from outside myself\" and, using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive behaviors that have been tormenting herThese and many other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.A book as inspiring as it is informative, as practical as it is profound, Mindsight offers exciting new proof that we aren't hardwired to behave in certain ways, but instead have the ability to harness the power of our minds to resculpt the neural pathways of our brains in ways that will be life-transforming.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Science", "Biology", "Neuroscience", "Health", "Parenting", "Personal Development", "Nonfiction", "Brain", "Self Help", "Mental Health"]}, "187444": {"bookid": "187444", "title": "Henry VIII", "author": "William Shakespeare", "series": "", "ratings": "8477", "reviews": "398", "rating": "3.51", "description": "Henry VIII is a history play generally believed to be a collaboration between William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, based on the life of Henry VIII of England.

You are now connected to a huge network of hundreds of thousands of fellow writers, and that feels both scary and exciting. By definition writing is a solitary profession. Writers need peace and quiet to gather their thoughts, to research, to dig deep into their subconscious for ideas. Marketers on the other hand need people, and the majority of authors are pretty poor at marketing and have absolutely no interest in it So I\u2019ve put this book together with the assistance of a number of fellow authors who\u2019ve all contributed a piece or two. My objectives with this book are a) to demonstrate to those just about to publish their first book the amount of work they should expect to put in afterwards, b) to perhaps offer direction, to advise on what works and what doesn\u2019t, and, I guess c) to establish for the reader just how hard authors have to graft to promote their work, which is why I\u2019ve included pieces from various authors, who all deserve my recognition and gratitude for demonstrating their often contradictory points of view. What worked for some, bombed when fellow authors tried the same tack, so it\u2019s crucial that I\u2019m true to myself and present the Indie industry in a genuinely transparent form.Thanks to these fellow authors - who\u2019ve contributed a full 28% between them - the reader will find a variety of opposing viewpoints, conflicting assessments and impressions of the industry, and differing outlooks and perspectives. The reader will also discover that a number of authors share identical points of experiences and viewpoints. Special thanks to all contributors, but especially Harpie for baring her soul in sharing excerpts from her wacky, psycho, screwball, demented diaries with us. You\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from Harpie in the future. WARNING: Writers can often be a precious breed of born-again goody-goodies. Me? I never ask anyone to like him. I never pretend to be anything that I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a handful and I know it. I\u2019m strong-willed, a bit outspoken and I write exactly what I\u2019m thinking. If strong language offends or you have an aversion to self-deprecating, piss-taking humour then please DO NOT buy this book, because I use these methods of bringing to light situations that just don't stack up. I truly believe that serious issues can be approached with humour, but I understand not everyone feels the same.So what, or specifically who, is the Storm that the title refers to? I\u2019ll tell you. The Storm refers to a group of people who have no issue whatsoever with an artist hiring out a gallery and displaying his paintings. They don\u2019t mind if a chef opens a new restaurant by inviting local residents to an opening night special, or a beautician promotes her services with the use of posters and referral specials for nails, waxing or sun beds. They don\u2019t even mind a scuba diving club offering come-and-try-it sessions. And they certainly don\u2019t object to a local swing band or orchestra advertising an upcoming concert. They don\u2019t even mind their friends trying out a recently acquired capacity for wine-making on them.BUT, if a hard-working author does similar, if he/she promotes the book they\u2019ve slaved over for the last year, this relentless and insidious enemy of all honest scribblers will have that poor author in their crosshairs in a New York heartbeat. If you\u2019re the Storm, you\u2019ll recognise yourself here.\n", "genres": ["Language", "Writing", "Nonfiction"]}, "24790": {"bookid": "24790", "title": "Paula", "author": "Isabel Allende", "series": "", "ratings": "39263", "reviews": "2723", "rating": "4.15", "description": "Paula es el libro m\u00e1s conmovedor, m\u00e1s personal y m\u00e1s \u00edntimo de Isabel Allende.

This is the question that poet Kathleen Norris asks us as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at St. John's Abbey in Minnesota. Part record of her time among the Benedictines, part meditation on various aspects of monastic life, The Cloister Walk demonstrates, from the rare perspective of someone who is both an insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world -- its liturgy, its ritual, its sense of community -- can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives. In this stirring and lyrical work, the monastery, often considered archaic or otherworldly, becomes immediate, accessible, and relevant to us, no matter what our faith may be.* A New York Times bestseller for 23 weeks* A New York Times Notable Book of the Year\n", "genres": ["Christian", "Biography", "Religion", "Autobiography", "Theology", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "Spirituality", "Nonfiction", "Christianity", "Faith"]}, "16076228": {"bookid": "16076228", "title": "Adversity Builds Character; An Inspirational True Life Story of Disability, Addiction and Acceptance", "author": "Tom Ufert", "series": "", "ratings": "40", "reviews": "10", "rating": "4.75", "description": "Adversity builds character is the story of a young man's life struggles to find his way through the trials and tribulations, family turmoil, self-determination and personal judgment.This transformational life experience, like so many, demonstrates the triumph of the human spirit over the pitfalls in our modern world.

From a divorce wrecked family life brought on by that by a disease ridden single mom, he is blessed with the first of many second chances. His godmother and her family, which becomes his stepparents, cause him to overcome personal character flaws. This new home life radically averts potential disaster and leads him to greater heights by redirecting the God-given talents of his character leading to never before realized academic and social achievements. At the height of his newfound career, his world is shattered yet again by the sudden tragic loss of his mother in a bizarre event of a mercy killing and suicide. While attempting to put this catastrophe behind him, drinking and sexual experimentation almost ruin his future hopes of a promising political career. He decides to study abroad and finds the first real love of his life. Yet short-lived and having to return, divorce of his stepparents again forces a change of direction, ultimately pointing the way to his true self. While postponing his career, he relocates and discovers a world where he finally feels at home and accepted without ridicule. As is so often the case where comfort and overconfidence leads to weakness and self-destruction, it is at this moment that one either succumbs to the burden of outside influence or gathers up all his strength to rise above like a phoenix.\n", "genres": []}, "465226": {"bookid": "465226", "title": "The Redbreast", "author": "Jo Nesb\u00f8", "series": "(Harry Hole #3)", "ratings": "95782", "reviews": "4555", "rating": "3.94", "description": "The Redbreast is a fabulous introduction to Nesb\u00f8\u2019s tough-as-nails series protagonist, Oslo police detective Harry Hole.

It was written at the end of the fifth century BCE in Athens, in the final years of the \"Golden Age\" of Athenian culture, and in the last year of Sophocles' own life. At the center of the play is the mysterious transformation of Oedipus from an old and blind beggar, totally dependent on his daughters, to the man who rises from his seat and, without help, leads everyone to the place where he is destined to die. In the background of this transformation stands the grove of the Furies, the sacred place of the implacable goddesses who pursue the violators of blood relationships. Although Oedipus, who killed his father and married his mother, is an obvious target of the Furies' vengeance, he enters their grove at the beginning of the play, sure that it is the resting place Apollo has predicted for him. The reversals and paradoxes in the play speak to the struggle that Oedipus' life and the action of the play bring vividly before us: how do we as humans, subject to constant change, find stable ground on which to stand and define our moral lives?

And they were all true. I'd come back from distant shores and speak of my adventures.  So much so in fact that people used to say, \"You should write a book.\"  My diatribes in my blogs and newspaper columns are simply my way of spinning the balls, because sometimes I like to see what number they land on. That\u2019s all.  But although I\u2019m known mostly as a raconteur - and most of my books can be described as coming from the humourist vein \u2013 in \u2018Nobody Asked Me\u2019 I touch on some subjects that are surely going to upset a few people.  I\u2019ve never quite understood the politically correct brigade. Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he\u2019s laughing. No longer simply a fad, blogging is now an important new literary innovation. This book is not a story, and if you\u2019re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It\u2019s not for you. I won\u2019t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I\u2019m not being controversial enough \u2013 and trust me when I say that in this book I get controversial.  Oh, don\u2019t worry; the humour that my fans seem to enjoy so much is still there, but right now the planet\u2019s spinning in new and scary directions, and this needs to be addressed. So inside the covers of this book I take a look at some of the challenges we\u2019re currently facing. And some of my opinions are going to rattle a few people.  So is a comedy writer honestly the best one to challenge some of the perceptions we\u2019re facing nowadays? Well, I\u2019ve always believed that if you can make people laugh then they tend to listen to what you say when you\u2019re serious. And my goal, my life\u2019s ambition if you like, is to give direction to comedy, purpose to satire.  So why the rabbit popping out of a tin of soup on the cover. Well \u2018Rabbit & Pork\u2019 is Cockney rhyming slang for Talk, and on more than one occasion I\u2019ve been accused of rabbiting away excessively \u2013 mostly at parties, and generally by my wife.  But why a tin of soup? Well I tend to believe that everyone is born perfect. Nobody is born with an inherent capacity to hate. It has to be taught. All of our experiences \u2013 family, school, work, the books we read, the newspapers we peruse, the music we listen to, our friends, our social life, the opinions of those around us, religion, sports we play or watch, those we love and those who love us, those we desire and those who desire us, those we travel with, our hopes and dreams and ambitions and achievements, our triumphs and disasters - go into a metaphorical cooking pot that we carry with us throughout our lives.  All these \u2018ingredients\u2019 make up our Soup of Life.  Now, when making a soup, once you\u2019ve added an ingredient, it\u2019s forever blended in and you can\u2019t take it out again. You add a sprinkling of finely chopped garnish; cumin or oregano, and you can never take that ingredient out again. Never, ever, ever. So say at the age of six you add black pepper or rosemary or hatred or love or comedy, from then onwards it\u2019ll always be part and parcel of your \u2018soup.\u2019 And as you add more ingredients the \u2018recipe\u2019 of your life evolves, and before you know it you can\u2019t taste the coriander or the love any more, but it\u2019s still there at a deep subliminal level. Remember that.  Some people may not add hatred until they\u2019re in their twenties, and most of us never add it at all.\n", "genres": ["Politics"]}, "30212771": {"bookid": "30212771", "title": "The Ipswich Bus", "author": "Robbie Franklin", "series": "", "ratings": "38", "reviews": "4", "rating": "4.76", "description": "A collection of extraordinary poems for ordinary people, written by Robbie, a fairly ordinary but talented man.

But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on \"validated learning,\" rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late.

Mitch Rapp's cover has been blown. After leading a team of commandos deep into Iraq to prevent Saddam Hussein from joining the nuclear arms race, he was publicly hailed by the president as the single most important person in the fight against terrorism. But after years of working covertly behind the scenes, Rapp now lives in the glare of the public spotlight, lauded by the nation and an easy target for virtually every terrorist from Jakarta to London.As special advisor on counterterrorism to CIA director Dr. Irene Kennedy, Rapp is ready to fight the war on terrorism from CIA headquarters rather than the front line. That is, until a platoon of Navy SEALs, sent to the Philippines to save an American family kidnapped by radical Islamic terrorists, is caught in a deadly ambush. The mission had been top secret -- so who told the enemy? All evidence points to the State Department and the Philippine embassy. But a greater threat still lurks. An unknown assassin working closely with the highest powers in the Middle East is bent on igniting war. Now, with the world watching his every move, will Rapp be able to overcome this anonymous foe and once again keep the flames of war from raging?Transporting us into an intriguing geopolitical puzzle full of deadly motives, covert operatives, and all the true-to-life insider detail we've come to expect from Vince Flynn, \"Executive Power\" is a high-flying story that delivers shattering suspense with the velocity of a 9mmbullet.\n", "genres": ["Mystery", "Mystery Thriller", "Fiction", "Spy Thriller", "Thriller", "Action", "Audiobook", "Espionage", "Adventure", "Suspense"]}, "9724798": {"bookid": "9724798", "title": "The Violets of March", "author": "Sarah Jio", "series": "", "ratings": "24387", "reviews": "2971", "rating": "3.82", "description": "A LIBRARY JOURNAL BEST BOOK OF 2011A heartbroken woman stumbled upon a diary and steps into the life of its anonymous author.

The Bride sweeps readers back to the savage beauty of medieval Scotland....  By the king's edict, Alec Kincaid, mightiest of the Scottish lairds, must take an English bride. And Jaime the youngest daughter of Baron Jamison, is his choice. From his first glimpse of the proud and beautiful English lady, Alec felt a burning hunger stir within him. This was a woman worthy of his fearless warrior's spirit. And he aches to touch her, tame her, possess her...forever.  But with the wedding vows, Jamie pledges her own secret oath: She will never surrender her love to this Highland barbarian. He was everything her heart warned her against -- an arrogant, brooding scoundrel whose rough good looks and seductive embrace fire her blood. But when strange accidents begin to threaten Jamie's life and an old rumor that Alec killed his first wife spreads anew, something far more dangerous than desire threatens to conquer her senses.  With all the storytelling power and insight into the human heart that have made her one of the bestselling authors of our time, Julie Garwood takes readers on an unforgettable romantic journey rich in humor, suspense, and historical detail.\n", "genres": ["Historical Romance", "Cultural", "Adult", "Romance", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Humor", "Historical", "Scotland", "Medieval Romance", "Medieval"]}, "813214": {"bookid": "813214", "title": "The Mist", "author": "Stephen King", "series": "(Skeleton Crew #1)", "ratings": "129977", "reviews": "3976", "rating": "3.95", "description": "It's a hot, lazy day, perfect for a cookout, until you see those strange dark clouds.

In How Not to Die, Dr. Michael Greger, the internationally-renowned nutrition expert, physician, and founder of NutritionFacts.org, examines the fifteen top causes of premature death in America -- heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Parkinson's, high blood pressure, and more -- and explains how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can sometimes trump prescription pills and other pharmaceutical and surgical approaches, freeing us to live healthier lives.The simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The fifteen leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.History of prostate cancer in your family? Put down that glass of milk and add flaxseed to your diet whenever you can. Have high blood pressure? Hibiscus tea can work better than a leading hypertensive drug-and without the side effects. Fighting off liver disease? Drinking coffee can reduce liver inflammation. Battling breast cancer? Consuming soy is associated with prolonged survival. Worried about heart disease (the number 1 killer in the United States)? Switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet, which has been repeatedly shown not just to prevent the disease but often stop it in its tracks.In addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top fifteen causes of death, How Not to Die includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen -- a checklist of the twelve foods we should consume every day. Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.\n", "genres": ["Food", "Nutrition", "Medicine", "Science", "Health", "Vegan", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook", "Self Help", "Diets", "Food and Drink"]}, "40656712": {"bookid": "40656712", "title": "Rabbit, Run", "author": "John Updike", "series": "(Rabbit Angstrom #1)", "ratings": "57121", "reviews": "3575", "rating": "3.58", "description": "Rabbit, Run is the book that established John Updike as one of the major American novelists of his\u2014or any other\u2014generation.

Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, and there\u2019s something about Chang . . . so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad can this thing be?

Walking away would have been easier.

These questions have puzzled us since the dawn of time, but when it became apparent to Jon Stewart and the writers of The Daily Show that the world was about to end, they embarked on a massive mission to write a book that summed up the human race: What we looked like; what we accomplished; our achievements in society, government, religion, science and culture -- all in a tome of approximately 256 pages with lots of color photos, graphs and charts. After two weeks of hard work, they had their book. EARTH (The Book) is the definitive guide to our species.

Edgar Hoover. The Lacuna is a poignant story of a man pulled between two nations as they invent their modern identities. Born in the United States, reared in a series of provisional households in Mexico\u2014from a coastal island jungle to 1930s Mexico City\u2014Harrison Shepherd finds precarious shelter but no sense of home on his thrilling odyssey. Life is whatever he learns from housekeepers who put him to work in the kitchen, errands he runs in the streets, and one fateful day, by mixing plaster for famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. He discovers a passion for Aztec history and meets the exotic, imperious artist Frida Kahlo, who will become his lifelong friend. When he goes to work for Lev Trotsky, an exiled political leader fighting for his life, Shepherd inadvertently casts his lot with art and revolution, newspaper headlines and howling gossip, and a risk of terrible violence. Meanwhile, to the north, the United States will soon be caught up in the internationalist goodwill of World War II. There in the land of his birth, Shepherd believes he might remake himself in America's hopeful image and claim a voice of his own. He finds support from an unlikely kindred soul, his stenographer, Mrs. Brown, who will be far more valuable to her employer than he could ever know. Through darkening years, political winds continue to toss him between north and south in a plot that turns many times on the unspeakable breach\u2014the lacuna\u2014between truth and public presumption. With deeply compelling characters, a vivid sense of place, and a clear grasp of how history and public opinion can shape a life, Barbara Kingsolver has created an unforgettable portrait of the artist\u2014and of art itself.

From iconic entrepreneurs to elite athletes, from artists to billionaire investors, their short profiles can help you answer life's most challenging questions, achieve extraordinary results, and transform your life.From the author: In 2017, several of my close friends died in rapid succession. It was a very hard year, as it was for many people. It was also a stark reminder that time is our scarcest, non-renewable resource. With a renewed sense of urgency, I began asking myself many questions: Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want? How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning? How could I be kinder to myself? How could I better say \u201cno\u201d to the trivial many to better say \u201cyes\u201d to the critical few? How could I best reassess my priorities and my purpose in this world? To find answers, I reached out to the most impressive world-class performers in the world, ranging from wunderkinds in their 20s to icons in their 70s and 80s. No stone was left unturned. This book contains their answers\u2014practical and tactical advice from mentors who have found solutions. Whether you want to 10x your results, get unstuck, or reinvent yourself, someone else has traveled a similar path and taken notes. This book, Tribe of Mentors, includes many of the people I grew up viewing as idols or demi-gods. Less than 10% have been on my podcast (The Tim Ferriss Show,\u00a0more than 200 million downloads), making this a brand-new playbook of playbooks. No matter your challenge or opportunity, something in these pages can help. Among other things, you will learn: \u2022 More than 50 morning routines\u2014both for the early riser and those who struggle to get out of bed. \u2022 How TED curator Chris Anderson realized that the best way to get things done is to let go. \u2022 The best purchases of $100 or less (you'll never have to think about the right gift again). \u2022 How to overcome failure and bounce back towards success. \u2022 Why Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton believes that the best art will always be the riskiest. \u2022 How to meditate and be more mindful (and not just for those that find it easy). \u2022 Why tennis champion Maria Sharapova believe that \u201closing makes you think in ways victories can\u2019t.\u201d \u2022 How to truly achieve work-life balance (and why most people tell you it isn\u2019t realistic). \u2022 How billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz transformed the way he engages with difficult situations to reduce suffering. \u2022 Ways to thrive (and survive) the overwhelming amount of information you process every day. \u2022 How to achieve clarity on your purpose and assess your priorities. \u2022 And much more.

Does The Appeal make the grade? And will it appeal to Grisham admirers -- or disappoint them?The stakes in the novel's plot are high: corporate crime on the largest scale. The duo of lawyers at the centre of the narrative are Mary and Wes Grace, who succeed in a multimillion dollar case against a chemical company, who have polluted a town with dumped toxic waste. A slew of agonising deaths have followed this, but lawyers for the chemical company appeal, and a variety of legal shenanigans are employed -- and it is certainly not clear which way the scales of justice will be finally balanced.As ever with Grisham, the mechanics of plotting are key, and the characterisation is functional rather than detailed. But it is (as always) more than capable of keeping the reader totally engaged. Given John Grisham's much-publicised conversion to born-again Christianity, it's intriguing to note here the implicit criticism of the moral majority's religious values, but that is hardly central to the enterprise. What counts is the storytelling, and while the writing is as straightforward and uncomplicated as ever, few readers will put down The Appeal once they have allowed it to exert its grip on upon them. --Barry Forshaw\n", "genres": ["Law", "Mystery", "Adult Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Fiction", "Thriller", "Audiobook", "Crime", "Suspense", "Legal Thriller"]}, "15016": {"bookid": "15016", "title": "The Complete Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue", "author": "Neale Donald Walsch", "series": "(Conversations with God #1-3)", "ratings": "6379", "reviews": "196", "rating": "4.25", "description": "An essential collection of Books 1, 2 and 3 in the Conversations with God series   This powerful and engaging volume collects the first and bestselling three books in Neale Donald Walsch's beloved Conversations with God series, complete with a foreword by the author.Offering a fresh perspective for spiritual seekers, Walsch's books have inspired millions of readers around \nAn essential collection of Books 1, 2 and 3 in the Conversations with God series   This powerful and engaging volume collects the first and bestselling three books in Neale Donald Walsch's beloved Conversations with God series, complete with a foreword by the author.Offering a fresh perspective for spiritual seekers, Walsch's books have inspired millions of readers around the world, introducing a compassionate, accessible God and deceptively simple truths that have the power to change lives forever.

He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight.com. Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the \"prediction paradox\": The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good-or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary-and dangerous-science.Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.\n", "genres": ["Economics", "Finance", "Sociology", "Business", "Psychology", "Politics", "Science", "Nonfiction", "Social Science", "Mathematics"]}, "772888": {"bookid": "772888", "title": "Woman on the Edge of Time", "author": "Marge Piercy", "series": "", "ratings": "15370", "reviews": "1130", "rating": "3.94", "description": "After being unjustly committed to a mental institution, Connie Ramos is contacted by an envoy from the year 2137, who shows her a utopian future of sexual and racial equality and environmental harmony.But Connie also bears witness to another potential outcome: a dystopian society of grotesque exploitation.
