For I am writing this not just from academic knowledge, but as I write it, I am also going through this same journey to receive my healing.The book will guide the reader through the Word of God in a logical progression of steps, making the reader aware of the power behind the Word, for Jesus came to give us life and life more abundantly, John 10:10. God's Word is able to meet all of our needs if we but let His Word work in our lives, for we are generally the one's that limit the Word from working. The Word can heal us both emotional, physically and bring us into a closer and a deeper relationship with Him.If the world that we live in was actually created by God's Word, (Jesus), John 1:3, then God's Word is the parent force of all creation. Scripture goes on to say, all things were created by Him and for Him, Colossians 1:16; thus Jesus had a purpose for creating His creation. If these two scriptures are true, then it would be to our benefit to learn about this Man Jesus Christ and His Word. If our focus remains on the Word, we will then be lead into that abundant life, that Jesus came to give us, rather than just settling for what the world can give us.The manuscript addresses many relevant topics in every day language concerning God's Word. There are many short and concise chapter topics, as shown in the table of contents: * IntroductionBeginning mind-sets: * God's Word the healing power  * Knowing that God is your Father  * Realizing that God is a good God  * Knowing God's love for you  * Knowing that God wants you well  * Having a strong desire to get well  * Leaving your past hurts in the past  * Will you receive God forgiveness? * You are worthy of God's healing  * Letting God's Word become real  * Desiring a closer walk with Him  * Having a thankful heart  * It will be done according to your faith  * A living God and His living Word  * Do not disqualify My people Pursuing every healing path possible: * Jesus took our infirmities  * Imagination and hope, a primary step  * What scriptures are you standing on  * Speaking life instead of death  * Speaking God's Word over your body  * Are you willing to be carried?  * Will you accept His free gift of healing  * Having the elders pray over you  * Asking others for a prayer of agreement  * Participating in Holy Communion  * Praise and worship, a powerful tool  * Healed by the spirit within us  * Walking in the authority as a son of God  * Having the Lord rebuke the devourer Biblical healing philosophies: * It's all about what Jesus accomplished  * Making the commitment to succeed  * It's a spiritual battle not a physical one  * Not quitting before the war is over  * As a man thinks in his heart so is he * Making God's Word your life source  * Living out of the spirit and not the flesh  * Natural healing vs. divine healing  * Healing vs. walking in wholeness  * Healing and wholeness, in this lifetime  * Becoming poor in spirit  * When you have done all, keep standing  * OK, I am standing, now what? The Journey Continues: * Be prepared to go it alone  * Allowing God's kingdom to reign within  * Divine healing comes by spiritual things  * Closing comments  * Epilogue\n", "genres": []}, "23126678": {"bookid": "23126678", "title": "Five Years - The Meeting", "author": "Leonard Belmont", "series": "", "ratings": "41", "reviews": "8", "rating": "4.46", "description": "Do you remember when you knew you were falling in love?What starts with a lucky encounter during their college years turns out to be a moment that will forever define their futures.That breathless, electric feeling in the air; giddy with the excitement of a new day.We have all experienced it in some way.

Is social media preventing you, or someone you know from achieving their dreams and desired opportunities? Quite frankly, it is hard to say, as usually when we are denied something, more frequently than not, we are never told why.From the statistics above, we can see that social media is a huge determining factor in whether or not us, our children or our friends and family are accepted into the college of our dreams or into our dream jobs. In my professional life, I have always been told that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In other words, it is better to be fully equipped and prepared for the opportunity as it arises, as opposed to wondering what we did wrong after we are passed up. Much like how a building must have their foundation built into the cornerstone that allows it to withstand the tests of time, we must have our foundation etched and chiseled out so we can be the best that we can be. This book, The Etiquette of Social Media, is the complete guide on the basic foundation that we all need to ensure that our online image is bulletproof from being judged by the decision makers of the world who may be able to have control of our destiny. Social Media is paving the way of the future. It is a new trend that is becoming standardized as a part of our daily lives. This new standard includes media outlets ranging from Facebook to LinkedIn to Quora and Twitter, along with many others. With how new social media is, there are no classes at our schools that cover the etiquette of social media. Whether you are in high school or a senior level executive, chances are you are oblivious to the guidelines of how to act on social media. In this day and age, that has been forgivable.Why? Because never before has there been a guide covering The Etiquette of Social Media, until now.Inspired by best-selling author James Altucher, Leonard Kim decided to write his first book of many. Being a personality with high visibility and a Top Writer on Quora, an Online Knowledge Market, Leonard has seen it all. From comments to messages to public attacks, Leonard has broken free from the viewpoint we all have of what is right in front of us. He has been able to expand outside of the myopic bubble of the Internet we have all come to see. He has expanded his view of our online society as a whole. In a single year, Leonard went from being a nobody to having over five million views on the internet. He went from being an introvert with less friends than he has fingers to cultivating friendships all across the world.Through decades of experience, Leonard has acquired a unique skill set. With a background in branding, Leonard understands the importance of your online reputation. He has been able to identify the key points to ensure that you come across as an approachable and likable human being. Are you looking to make new friends? Manage your online reputation? Or expand your business connections? This book will provide you with the essential tools you need to get ahead. The world is changing. Soon it will no longer be forgivable to be ignorant of your behavior on social media. People will start to judge you for each action you make.

Spending her teenage years in forced prostitution, befriending the pharmacist who lived next door to the brothel, and building up a steely facade made her the perfect candidate for the murder-for-money lifestyle. But now it's time to come home. Upon her return to Southern California, she attempts to fit into a family unit who doesn't understand what she's been through and suspects she's a psychopath-which may not be entirely incorrect. And they don't have much room to point fingers anyway. They're embroiled in a money laundering and people smuggling business, which is currently under attack. Magda, as recalcitrant as a mule, sets out to unmask the threat and serve her own brand of justice. She wants to protect her family, but what she needs is to make amends with her wrongdoings, face her past traumas, and finally find a place in the world where she can fit in. High stakes, cold blood, and dark humor spiral around this fierce, female assassin, whose journey takes her through Baja California, Barcelona, and suburban Los Angeles in a snarky combination of crime noir and chick lit. Magda's story is an action-packed and emotional exploration of taking responsibility for your choices and paying for those of your parents.\n", "genres": []}, "22352386": {"bookid": "22352386", "title": "Sixteenth Notes: The Breaking of the Rose-Colored Glasses", "author": "Taylor Rhodes", "series": "", "ratings": "9", "reviews": "2", "rating": "4.78", "description": "This is a story about the climb out of depression, out of addiction, out of lust that I didn't deserve or shouldn't consider love.

Now, in an updated edition, Rachel Simon reflects on changes in her life, Beth's life, and the lives of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The highlight is Beth's update, which is in her own words. A new reader's guide is also included. Join these two unforgettable sisters on their journey, this time in an even deeper and richer way.Rachel Simon\u2019s sister Beth is a spirited woman who lives intensely and often joyfully. Beth, who has an intellectual disability, spends her days riding the buses in her unnamed Pennsylvania city. The drivers, a lively group, are her mentors; her fellow passengers are her community. One day, Beth asks Rachel to accompany her on the buses for an entire year. This wise, funny, deeply affecting true story is the chronicle of that remarkable time. Rachel, a writer and college teacher whose hyperbusy life camouflaged her emotional isolation, had much to learn in her sister\u2019s extraordinary world.

This plea includes a vague warning, giving the U.N. a week to comply or Charles will take action.

Sid's Place is a rare inside look at the underground lifestyles of the Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan years.\"The information in SID'S PLACE is based upon my personal experiences. Ernest Hemingway inspired me with his concept of transforming his life into fictional stories. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done here. It\u2019s possible I have revealed sensitive or classified government secret service information, but it is so old and outdated I couldn\u2019t remember who told me what or who did what... even if they pumped me full of truth serum.\"\"Yes, I was a drug dealer from 1968 to 1970, but I was only 14 to 16 years old. Many of these experiences were my friends or their older brothers. Having not read this book for many years prior to this rewrite it was a fun flashback for me as I relived this book, or in many cases remembered the girls who inspired the love scenes.\"\"Restrain your contempt for me if you\u2019re anti-drugs, anti-sex, anti-anti-war... and for all the splinter groups I may have offended--please don't get pissed... Whew! My goal is to be loved and liked. I hope to make friends with this book, not enemies. If you hate this book, too bad, bug off and leave me alone. I\u2019ve already had plenty of hate mail, threats on my answer machine... so don\u2019t waste your time.\"\"One of my motives for writing this book was to explore how things might have gone for me under different circumstances. Like Tom, I got busted in my van, but I hung around and got a lucky break when my Uncle offered to take me in, in Newfoundland. My accomplice friend went to jail, I went to Newfoundland. Another motive for writing this book was to explore the possible error of my pacifistic passivity. I take a quiet pride in the fact I have not killed anyone in this current lifetime, and despite opportunities and good reasons, still decided not to when other people were encouraging me. In this story I pushed myself to the limit where I would take a life, purposefully. Better my imagination than reality. As for the drug tripping, I explored that plenty in reality, or different realities. I\u2019ve got a lot more of those stories to tell. So enjoy a glimpse of my teenage world.

Once Wellman has lead your imagination down the path to create these images, they will come back to visit you time and again.These stories are very short and many of them can be read in less than five minutes. This is one of the best cases of quality defeating quantity ever witnessed. One story may be supernatural, while another is about your criminally insane neighbor, and yet a third somehow combines the worst of both of those worlds.This book contains strong language, graphic violence, and explicit sexual activity.

It is based on the Toyota (lean) model, which combines operational excellence with value-based strategies to produce steady growth through a wide range of economic conditions.  In contrast with the crash-and-burn performance of companies trumpeted by business gurus in the 1990s, the firms profiled in Lean Thinking -- from tiny Lantech to midsized Wiremold to niche producer Porsche to gigantic Pratt & Whitney -- have kept on keeping on, largely unnoticed, along a steady upward path through the market turbulence and crushed dreams of the early twenty-first century. Meanwhile, the leader in lean thinking -- Toyota -- has set its sights on leadership of the global motor vehicle industry in this decade.  Instead of constantly reinventing business models, lean thinkers go back to basics by asking what the customer really perceives as value. (It's often not at all what existing organizations and assets would suggest.) The next step is to line up value-creating activities for a specific product along a value stream while eliminating activities (usually the majority) that don't add value. Then the lean thinker creates a flow condition in which the design and the product advance smoothly and rapidly at the pull of the customer (rather than the push of the producer). Finally, as flow and pull are implemented, the lean thinker speeds up the cycle of improvement in pursuit of perfection. The first part of this book describes each of these concepts and makes them come alive with striking examples.  Lean Thinking clearly demonstrates that these simple ideas can breathe new life into any company in any industry in any country. But most managers need guidance on how to make the lean leap in their firm. Part II provides a step-by-step action plan, based on in-depth studies of more than fifty lean companies in a wide range of industries across the world.  Even those readers who believe they have embraced lean thinking will discover in Part III that another dramatic leap is possible by creating an extended lean enterprise for each of their product families that tightly links value-creating activities from raw materials to customer.  In Part IV, an epilogue to the original edition, the story of lean thinking is brought up-to-date with an enhanced action plan based on the experiences of a range of lean firms since the original publication of Lean Thinking.  Lean Thinking does not provide a new management \"program\" for the one-minute manager. Instead, it offers a new method of thinking, of being, and, above all, of doing for the serious long-term manager -- a method that is changing the world.\n", "genres": ["Productivity", "Self Help", "Buisness", "Business", "Leadership", "Management", "Entrepreneurship", "Nonfiction", "Economics", "Personal Development"]}, "23777101": {"bookid": "23777101", "title": "Introducing Charlotte", "author": "Charlotte Hains", "series": "", "ratings": "16", "reviews": "11", "rating": "4.69", "description": "Seduction is just as much about the mind as it is the body.

Their cheeks play along, creating a new harmony. Making them cute and lovable. Flower was maxing out this experience. Her eyes were, to be more precise. She was smiling through her eyes.

But for writer T.K. Thorne, just one reference was enough to ignite her imagination and form the basis for her dazzling new novel, ANGELS AT THE GATE (Cappuccino Books, March 2015). Like Noah\u2019s Wife, Thorne\u2019s highly praised debut, this book brings the ancient world to life through the eyes of an extraordinary woman.Based on historical, biblical, and archaeological research, visits to the Middle East, and a large measure of creativity, ANGELS AT THE GATE is the story of Adira, destined to become Lot\u2019s wife. A daughter of Abram's tribe, Adira is an impetuous young girl whose mother died in childbirth. Secretly raised as a boy in her father\u2019s caravan and schooled in languages and the art of negotiation, Adira rejects the looming changes of womanhood that threaten her nomadic life and independence. But with the arrival of two mysterious strangers \u2013 Northmen rumored to be holy or possibly even \u201cAngels\u201d \u2013 Adira\u2019s world unravels. Raiders invade the caravan, and she loses everything she values most \u2013 her father, her freedom, and even the \u201cAngels.\u201d Caught between her oath to her father to return to her tribe and the \u201cproper life for a woman\u201d and tormented by an impossible love, she abandons all she has known in a dangerous quest to seek revenge and find her kidnapped \u201cAngel.\u201d With only her beloved dog, Nami, at her side, Adira must use the skills she learned in the caravan to survive the perils of the desert, Sodom, and her own heart. ANGELS AT THE GATE is a story of adventure and the power of love, exploring themes about choice \u2013 the importance of asking the right questions and walking the fine edge between duty and personal freedom. Based on a simple mention in the Bible, T.K. Thorne has developed a complex and full-bodied character in the wife of Lot, a woman both ancient and modern, who will touch readers\u2019 hearts, and live in their memories for years to come. As Dianne Mooney, founder of Southern Living At Home says, \u201cFor all those whose curiosity is piqued by how it might have been in the time of Sodom and Gomorrah, this is a must read!\u201d \u201cA masterpiece of historical research, interweaving history and theology in a re-visioning of an ancient story from a woman\u2019s perspective.

It began when a budding young woman was lured into a cunning and deceptive scheme which eventually became her undoing. The tale may have gone unnoticed under normal circumstances. However, the plot thickened when a famous celebrity, Bill Cosby, was the target of a greedy rouse. The timing couldn\u2019t have been worse as it fell on the heels of his son's murder. Ennis Cosby had been shot and killed the day an alleged extortion letter was delivered to the comedian demanding millions in hush money. During one of the most infamous trials of 1997 Cosby would face his adversary Autumn Jackson, and rue the day that she was born.

In what modern Indians mistakenly call the Indus Valley Civilisation. The inhabitants of that period called it the land of Meluha \u2013 a near perfect empire created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of the greatest monarchs that ever lived.This once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis. To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appear to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with astonishing martial skills.The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient legend: \u2018When evil reaches epic proportions, when all seems lost, when it appears that your enemies have triumphed, a hero will emerge.\u2019Is the rough-hewn Tibetan immigrant Shiva, really that hero?

Even the perfect empire, Meluha is riddled with a terrible secret in Maika, the city of births. Unknown to Shiva, a master puppeteer is playing a grand game. In a journey that will take him across the length and breadth of ancient India, Shiva searches for the truth in a land of deadly mysteries \u2013 only to find that nothing is what it seems.Fierce battles will be fought.

Glory and her family move from Boston city life to rural cow country where people have heard of Jews but never seen a real one. A coming of age tale of a girl who doesn't understand why her sister won't talk to her and even Mother Nature seems out to get her. She cries out to the gods for help. But nobody sees her terrible self inflicted wounds. No one is paying attention. In this coming of age debut novel, C.F. Joyce explores the roles that family histories, clashing cultures, and dysfunctions play in the life of a young girl.  Under the unpublished title \"Memories of Glory\", the novel won a HarperCollins Top 5 Gold Medal award. Here are some of the reviewer's comments:  \"It is very difficult to approach a \u2018coming of age\u2019 story, and write in such a way as to not appear clich\u00e9d, but [the author] has made a remarkably strong case. In \u2018Memories of Glory\u2019, the journey from childhood to adulthood is dealt with in a unique way; the six children in Glory\u2019s family are used to explore various different facets of growing up. The reader is also able to understand more about the pasts of Glory\u2019s parents and their families, allowing adult tensions to be explored too. A compelling feminist take on life dominates, but the feelings of the important men in Glory\u2019s life are not left uncovered. The memories she recalls do not depict a clear straightforward story, rather each is a part of a puzzle which in the end paints an often brutal but fair conclusion on life...Glory is set up well as a whimsical day-dreamer. She lives in an alter-world, and her intelligence and desire to be elsewhere helps build a strong picture of her imagination. Gradually it becomes clear that the world she fashions for herself is an escape from the harsh life that she has had to lead. As a protagonist she is wonderful; her suffering is a result of both her surroundings and of universal teenage trauma: I found her hugely accessible...The use of dialogue, and the focus on different characters in each recollection, allows the reader to build a strong concept of each family member, and their relationships with one another. This is a vibrant read, and no connection is left unexplored. Friendship, as well as sibling rivalry, is beautifully drawn out...The author clearly has a gift for wit and charm, illustrated in the passage where the family go blueberry picking...The role of \u201cMother Nature\u201d, of fate and fortune, is an interesting theme and one that gives an interesting dimension to the family\u2019s attitude.\"\n", "genres": []}, "24121022": {"bookid": "24121022", "title": "Quit or Die Trying", "author": "Alison Beard", "series": "", "ratings": "19", "reviews": "5", "rating": "4.37", "description": "When smokers coughed and coughed and couldn't stop coughing, Alison Beard made the same snide remarks as anyone who has never smoked: smoke another one!

She asked the same question: why don't they just quit? Even as a smoker, Alison was certain that she would never be like those smokers.

This outing is going to be Epic! Henry is a man on the run. The beast chasing him wears the face of his murdered wife. Fueled by guilt, the beast has him running the gauntlet of an ever-hopeful, but chronically unsuccessful suicide marathon. He's spent the last four years running away from his life. During the workweek, he merely exists, performing the inevitable and necessary functions of life, moving through his world like an automaton. But when that assembly line of existence ultimately reaches its end on Friday afternoon, Henry launches into orbit on a liquor propelled rocket. His flight begins when he straps himself into his favorite barstool late Friday and ends with his splashdown sometime late Sunday night, and the time spent in between is a fog of chaotic memories. During this latest flight, however, he experiences some unexpected turbulence. This time he crash-lands seven hundred miles from home, unencumbered by a car or wallet. Hungover, angry, and broke, he's forced to hitchhike his way back, trolling for rides along the hot, dusty backland highways of New Mexico. But the real story begins with the procession of characters he encounters along the way. The cowboy bartender, the lovesick preacher, the militant social worker, the escaped convict, the psychic, and the woman with the kryptonite eyes, all find their way past his barricades. Each one manages to make contact with him and help him find another piece of himself. Each one helps him find the strength necessary to finally bury his dead and re-enter his life.

What started off as a couple of months to get away for an adventure turned into a ten-year journey of learning, enlightenment, hard times, and moments that will never leave me, including times of joy, sorrow, love, pain, near-death experiences, and experiences nearly worth dying for. During that time, I travelled to over 60 countries, set foot on every continent, including Antarctica; worked in over half a dozen countries; and saw relics from ancient civilisations and technological marvels of the modern world. I saw the highest peak on earth, the lowest valley, and so much in between. I visited places where they had never seen a white man before and countries ruled by governances ranging from democracies to theocracies to military regimes. I saw the cruelty that humanity can have for each other as well as the love that can bind us all. I fell in love, had my heart broken a few times, and broke a few hearts of my own. ~Carpe Diem\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Travel", "Adventure"]}, "20464904": {"bookid": "20464904", "title": "Kill Thy Neighbor", "author": "Mike  Miller", "series": "", "ratings": "10", "reviews": "2", "rating": "4.40", "description": "A lively story about dying, a mind-bending thriller and a pitch-black comedy. \"The message is why you keep the gun under your pillow.

Perhaps you have had dreams about being one of the few left and what you would do in order to survive.  It doesn\u2019t matter If you think that the chances of a zombie apocalypse are next to zero. There are plenty of other types of scenarios that can occur. There may be a meteor in space that creates serious damages her on Earth. Even though nuclear weapons seem to be more controlled than in the 80\u2019s, that doesn\u2019t mean the risk of nuclear war is off the table.  What about the risks of natural disasters that are devastating in terms of the volume of damage that they can create? In recent years, the number of tornadoes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters have continued to increase. There can be many reasons for this including changes in overall climate.  You can make yourself crazy and lose sleep thinking about the what ifs. A better way to handle all of it is to prepare for the worst case scenario. Hopefully, you would never need to have such items put to use. Yet if you do, you will significantly increase your chances of survival.  We live in a society where it seems so easy to get what you need that we take for granted how tough it would play out with a huge disaster. No more buying what you need online or walking into a grocery store for food. No more electricity when you flip a switch or running water when you turn on the faucet.  While we can\u2019t control the events that may one day unfold, we can control how we are prepared for them. With some basic items stored, you can have an upper hand on many other people that failed to get anything in place. Creating some types of allies that you would be able to depend on if you had a need during such time could make the difference between life and death.  \n", "genres": []}, "24381375": {"bookid": "24381375", "title": "Cowboys Last All Night", "author": "Jennifer Ashley", "series": "(Riding Hard #1)", "ratings": "564", "reviews": "64", "rating": "4.16", "description": "From five New York Times and USA Today bestselling authors, a collection of ALL NEW, no cliffhanger stories.New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Ashley brings you \nAdam\n from a new series: Riding Hard, starring the Campbell brothers, a family of stunt riders and stuntmen who train at their ranch in Texas Hill Country.

These three chapters explain how a child responds emotionally and physically to their environment and most importantly to you. The simple solutions presented in this three step process support you and your child in setting you both up for a long and quiet sleep. I also include a Bedtime Routine Journal in which you record your new routine activities for the first six weeks. In the journal there are questions for you to answer to provide introspection on how you are doing and how your child is responding. This gives you more control over making these changes. Any change brings on resistance. What has been working for your baby/child and hasn't been working for you and now that you are determined to make the changes necessary to bring on a good nights sleep, you need reinforcement. The change in routine may make things worse for a few weeks. However, as you record and get through the resistance, you will discover that when it seems to hit the worst peak that the resistant behavior suddenly disappears and the routine has been established. Children crave consistency even when they don't know what it is or how to get there. We change when we are in enough pain to make us reach for a new behavior, this is the change! As a bonus there are three appendices that provide additional supports for overall hassle free parenting. These suggestions support and enhance the two way communication between the parent or caregiver and the child. We have often heard it said that, \"Children do not come with instructions!\" This is not true. Children come with built in instructions. What is missing is our belief that children are not born communicating with us, simply because they do not meet our communication needs for verbal expression. Because they don't use our words we mistakenly believe they are not born communicating. Raising children does not have to be frustrating or emotionally overwhelming when we know how to hear them and how to support them as they communicate life is easier and happier for the whole family!\n", "genres": []}, "23494599": {"bookid": "23494599", "title": "Libellus de Numeros", "author": "Jim    West", "series": "(Magicae Mathematica #1)", "ratings": "120", "reviews": "68", "rating": "4.30", "description": "What is the missing variable?Alex, a young precocious girl, mysteriously gets transported to a strange world where Latin and Math combine in formulas and equations with magical effects.

Brennan\u2019s husband is posted to a small village in Italy, Montecchia di Crosara, and the abrupt move is a challenge to the family. Brennan must find herself while learning to live with her family in such foreign but ultimately healing surroundings. After her daughter\u2019s death, Janet lost faith in everything. Apart from a few healing practices of going up and down a hill where Brennan observes an old woman talking to her deceased husband at his gravesite and listening to a local band\u2019s practice music coming from a shed, all that remained was Nature with its dark woods and simple invitation. We witness Janet in the depth of heartsickness slowly but surely being able to kick up her feet \u201cin a mock Tarantella,\u201d thus starting a freeing ritual in nature that would not fail her. Her dancing in the woods becomes a \u201cpriestlike task of pure ablution\u201d in the world of nature, and this helps her to get rid of her pain She now experiences Nature\u2019s healing power like Wordsworth in his Tintern Abbey.AUTHOR BIOJanet K.

Care provided to those near death or dying is an evolving process.  Before Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross\u2019s book, On Death & Dying, was published in 1969, rarely were dying patients or patients with cancer told of their diagnosis. Kubler-Ross\u2019s descriptions of patient experiences created a paradigm shift in the care of dying patients and their loved ones that included a better understanding of their psychological needs. A decade later the Uniform Brain Death Act was passed to establish criteria for determining biological death needed because of advances in life support technology.  We know now occurrences near death or dying involve more than biology and psychology. There is a transpersonal component needing to be fully integrated into the care of individuals and their family members. In this book, Madelaine Lawrence, PhD, describes the known transpersonal experiences associated with near death and dying and how, in some cases, they challenge our current understanding of psychological needs and biological death. The presentation of known transpersonal experiences in one source provides a needed holistic view. Lawrence calls for an integration of these transpersonal experiences into mainstream science and education of the public, family members and health care providers in order to provide comprehensive care of those near death and dying. \n", "genres": []}, "24085920": {"bookid": "24085920", "title": "Zaria Fierce and the Secret of Gloomwood Forest", "author": "Keira Gillett", "series": "(Zaria Fierce #1)", "ratings": "67", "reviews": "43", "rating": "4.28", "description": "\"Come here Princess, and let me eat you.\"On her birthday, Zaria Fierce finds her usual path to school blocked by an ugly river-troll.

One size does not fit all. Everyone's brain is different.Helping others 'get it' when it comes to dealing with those with so-called learning disabilities is why Reitman has written this book. It's also why he wrote and produced The Square Root of 2, a movie about a college student who encounters\u2014and fights\u2014her school's unjust system. The film was inspired by the real events faced by his daughter and contributing author, Rebecca, when she went to college; her seizure disorder and\u2014at the time\u2014undiagnosed Asperger syndrome posed unique challenges not faced by most students.After reviewing the scientific community's research, conducted over the last nearly 40 years, Dr. Reitman believes that it's time to not just accept neurodiversity, but to embrace it, and this book will help people do just that. It is the first book to offer simple tools, action plans and resources to help understand and deal with anyone whose brain is a bit different. The astonishing rate of autism births alone (1 in 68) means that society will have to adapt to neurodiversity, just as it has had to adapt to other cultural and racial differences. Our educational system, our workplaces, and society at large will no longer be one size fits all\u2014each individual will have the opportunity to maximize their potential\u2014and we will be the better for it. Dr. Harold \"Hackie\" Reitman is an orthopedic surgeon, a former professional and Golden Gloves champion heavyweight boxer, philanthropist, and a movie producer. His recent release, The Square Root of 2, is a fictionalized adaptation of his daughter Rebecca's challenges at college (TheSquareRootOf2.com).\n", "genres": ["Self Help", "Neurodiversity", "Autistic Spectrum Disorder", "Psychology", "Nonfiction", "Health"]}, "25155693": {"bookid": "25155693", "title": "The Last of Her Kind", "author": "JoAnn Rackear Goldrich", "series": "", "ratings": "21", "reviews": "9", "rating": "3.67", "description": "Alone on post-apocalyptic Earth, young Charly Willow struggles to survive nuclear winter and find her family, until her chance meeting with a dying stranger.

All rights reserved.An extraordinary desire drives you. You have a story to tell. You have a product, service, idea, or vision to sell---at home or at work. How you choose to communicate your message and connect with your target audience will make the difference between success and failure.When you make a decision to communicate your message like a Bridge Builder, you will achieve more of what you want. You\u2019ll be a Superb Communicator who is able to persuade audiences:To listen. To engage. To connect. To buy your products. To join your causes. To approve your initiatives. To fund your ideas. To believe in your vision. To let you lead.The premise of this book is simple: You already know how to be a Bridge Builder---although you may not realize it. Like most people, you\u2019ve probably forgotten. But you\u2019ve successfully built bridges before. Intention, not perfection, helped you achieve what you wanted. And intention, not perfection, will help you achieve what you want in the future. When you operate from the principles illustrated in the story and in the Approach that follows it, the results you achieve will amaze you.Getting the Most from the StoryStories are often used to communicate important principles. Why? Because we all relate to life through stories. We see aspects of ourselves in the characters, and we hope to gain new insights about business and life from the way they react and the things they learn in the story.The parable in this book is about a man named Daniel who, like us, has a problem (how to communicate effectively with others) but doesn\u2019t recognize the source of his problem or how to solve it. Daniel needs to become a Bridge Builder in order to get what he truly wants, but he struggles to accept the solution to his problem because of past failure, preconceptions, and misunderstandings. He exemplifies the individuals I encounter every day in one-to-one coaching and the corporate consulting process.The characters in this story represent composites of real business professionals I\u2019ve worked with, not anyone in particular. However, early feedback from readers that represent varied industries and cultures tells me that the characters and themes in the story will resonate with most readers in more ways than one.This story applies to business communication, but it also applies to communication at home, at school, at church, and in any organizational setting. Because the story deals with communication and leadership principles, anyone will benefit from reading it, whether or not they work in the corporate world.Organizations, large or small, will also reap the profits of intentionally nurturing a culture of Bridge Builder Communication and Bridge Builder Leadership\u2014and so will those inside those organizations, whether they\u2019re executives, scientists, engineers, sales reps, entrepreneurs, educators, pastors or Creatives. That has been my experience.I suggest that you first read and reflect on the story.

It is a poetry collection that reaches for the hearts of anyone who has ever fallen in love, thought of falling in love, fallen out of love, or is in love with the idea of love.Written in letter format, the collection includes a few sonnets, a couple villanelles, and a pantoum among the formal verse poetry, but mostly it is an experimentation with prose poetry and free verse that hardly seems free at times due to the skill with which the poet wields words.Dear Lover, includes Lori Jenessa Nelson's sharp eye for detail and idea organization, as well as her ability to express these ideas using the most evocative language, and effective, if not always proper, grammar. She wields the vocabularies that she has gleaned from her artistic background in a way that adds a delicious realism to even the saddest of poems.Because love does not always come with lovers, Dear Lover, also includes a section about casual sex, because Nelson frowns severely on slut-shaming and believes in the power of sexual freedom associated with \"having sex the way that men do.\" She accepts the positive and negative that comes with the act and includes her experiences in the collection.Love is not always easy and that\u2019s what this poetry attempts to communicate.Let's talk about relationships.

In The Smoke at Dawn, the last great push of the Army of the Cumberland sets the stage for a decisive confrontation at Chattanooga that could determine the outcome of the war. \u00a0 Summer, 1863. The Federal triumph at Vicksburg has secured complete control of the Mississippi River from the Confederacy, cementing the reputation of Ulysses S. Grant. Farther east, the Federal army under the command of William Rosecrans captures the crucial rail hub at Chattanooga. But Rosecrans is careless, and while pursuing the Confederates, the Federal forces are routed in north Georgia at Chickamauga Creek. Retreating in a panic back to Chattanooga, Rosecrans is pursued by the Confederate forces under General Braxton Bragg. Penned up, with their supply lines severed, the Federal army seems doomed to the same kind of defeat that plagued the Confederates at Vicksburg. But a disgusted Abraham Lincoln has seen enough of General Rosecrans. Ulysses Grant is elevated to command of the entire theater of the war, and immediately replaces Rosecrans with General George Thomas. Grant gathers an enormous force, including armies commanded by Joseph Hooker and Grant\u2019s friend, William T. Sherman. Grant\u2019s mission is clear: Break the Confederate siege and destroy Bragg\u2019s army.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Bragg wages war as much with his own subordinates as he does with the Federals, creating dissension and disharmony in the Southern ranks, erasing the Confederate army\u2019s superiority at exactly the wrong time. \u00a0 Blending evocative historical detail with searing depictions of battle, Jeff Shaara immerses readers in the world of commanders and common soldiers, civilians and statesmen. From the Union side come the voices of Generals Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and George Thomas\u2014the vaunted \u201cRock of Chickamauga\u201d\u2014as well as the young private Fritz \u201cDutchie\u201d Bauer. From the Rebel ranks come Generals Bragg, Patrick Cleburne, and James Longstreet, as well as the legendary cavalry commander, Nathan Bedford Forrest.

But how do you manage an aging, immutably stubborn Holocaust survivor who has risen above the squalor of Poland\u2019s ghettos; fled across the war-torn German wilderness; and survived the winter-ravaged Pyrenees alone on foot with three children? You probably don't.Managing Bubbie is the heartrending, hilarious family memoir by Russel Lazega that recounts the frequently hectic, ever-exhausting trials of one Jewish family in Miami Beach as they try to oversee the care of the elderly, unmanageable Lea Lazega. As they scramble for an acceptable assisted living facility and struggle to get her medication in line, they discover the difficulties of controlling a woman who time and again eluded catastrophe by refusing to be told what to do. A tapestry of an American family in the 1980s, Managing Bubbie also revisits the Holocaust period to mine the love, hope, and humor that emerged from the deepest despair. Anyone who savors a soft heart with a sharp funny bone will laugh, cry, and commiserate with the confounded family who must manage their beloved, impossible Bubbie.\n", "genres": ["Cultural", "Holocaust", "Autobiography", "North American Hi...", "World War II", "Historical", "Spain", "American History", "Family", "Nonfiction", "History", "Biography", "Memoir", "War"]}, "21810492": {"bookid": "21810492", "title": "Money Moves That Matter: Simple Steps to Become Debt-Free", "author": "Tagene Brown-McBean", "series": "", "ratings": "11", "reviews": "2", "rating": "3.82", "description": "In Money Moves That Matter, financial expert Tagene Brown-McBean equips you with the information you will need on how to win with money.

Her plans pivot when she meets a devadasi--an aging dancer--in her compartment. When the woman Mallika opens her drawstring bag and buys Sowmya her dinner, Sowmya recognizes what she needs to overcome her own condition, that of a young woman in possession of a thin cotton sari, a head shorn clean, and little else. She asks Mallika how she too can achieve that kind of power--the power to open a bag and pull out money. Thus begins Sowmya's transformation in the city by the sea, Madras, which is in the grip of its own political and social changes while India is struggling to seize its independence from the imperial British raj.

Psychological and physical wounds from the camps could not heal. Home life was marked by great sadness, extreme feelings of guilt, and often stringent rules of behavior.Broken on the Inside, written by Simon Hammelburg, a well-known Dutch journalist and son of Holocaust survivors, is a novel about Jewish survivors and their children. Based on his own life as well as interviews with 1200 other survivors. These interviews were transcribed during telephone calls he received in a 1992 campaign to help American Jews and other individuals reclaiming property they had lost during the Nazi regime in the former DDR. The calls Simon Hammelburg received were often long monologues about experiences in concentration camps like Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and even Sobibor, depicting the horrible tales of escapes, hiding, revealing unknown facts about WWII. The witness statements provided unique insights into the psychological aftermath of the Holocaust survivors and their children. The author describes in heart-breaking terms how he and other children of survivors escaped their tormented home life by joining Habonim-Dror, the Socialist Zionist youth movement. Though only one of the young people in the novel succeeds in making aliyah, the rest remain loyal to Israel and the memories of their grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.In 1996 the book \u2018Kaddish for Daisy\u2019 was published only in Dutch language. It was the debut novel of Simon Hammelburg concerning victims of the Holocaust and their children. The book received some critical acclaim but disappeared from bookshops shortly after publication and has not been available until 2014. Over a period of 18 years, Simon Hammelburg has continued to refine the original manuscript. Now the time has come to publish the final version in Dutch and English.The protagonist loses his wife in a car crash and while in mourning, he revisits places where together, they had found happiness. During this journey he connects with his peers, his brother and parents. Hammelburg not only describes these meetings but focuses on the many conversations held about the persecution in the camps, the need to stay in hiding, the hope for a new life in Israel and the loneliness in a post-war Europe too busy with its reconstruction. The tragedy of the Holocaust becomes tangible for those who have to live on.\u2018I know all about it Daisy. And yet I cannot get angry.

Although they have been mentioned in the bible and traces of their existence are scattered throughout the globe, Peter Madeloy had always presumed that the myths of the possible existence of an ancient brotherhood, living on Earth for milennia, was nothing more than that, a myth.

Peter enlists the help of his uncle, Daniel O'Brien, a professor of Philology and avid researcher of veiled organisations and his wife, Emily, a geneticist, to unravel a series of clues his father has left him.

With compassion, humor, insight, and practical wisdom born of firsthand experience, Galit Breen makes a compelling case for online decency. What would happen if parents and kids everywhere could read these 10 simple rules of conduct, learn them by heart, and live by them each and every time they log in? The world would change dramatically--and for the good of us all.\"--Katrina Kenison, author of Mitten Strings for God and The Gift of an Ordinary DayIf kindness wins, accountability rules. The need for this mantra is never clearer than when scrolling through posts and comments online.Approximately four out of ten kids (42 percent) have experienced cyberbullying. When we were young, our bullies weren't usually strangers. They were the kids who passed mean notes about us in class, the ones who didn't let us sit at their table during lunch, and the ones who tripped us in the hallway or embarrassed us in gym class. Cyberbullying isn't all that different from the playground bullying of our youth and nightmares. But with social media, our bullies have nonstop access to us--and our kids. In fact, we're often \"friends\" with our bullies online.When freelance writer Galit Breen's kids hinted that they'd like to post, tweet, and share photos on Instagram, Breen took a look at social media as a mom and as a teacher and quickly realized that there's a ridiculous amount of kindness terrain to teach and explain to kids\u2015and some adults\u2015before letting them loose online. So she took to her pen and wrote a how-to book for parents who are tackling this issue with their kids.Kindness Wins covers ten habits to directly teach kids as they're learning how to be kind online. Each section is written in Breen's trademark parent-to-parent-over-coffee style and concludes with resources for further reading, discussion starters, and bulleted takeaways. She ends the book with two contracts\u2015one to share with peers and one to share with kids. Just like we needed to teach our children how to walk, swim, and throw a ball, we need to teach them how to maneuver kindly online. This book will help you do just that.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Business", "Parenting", "Amazon"]}, "24218546": {"bookid": "24218546", "title": "Come Back Strong: A Widow's Song", "author": "Eileen McGuire Whaley", "series": "", "ratings": "16", "reviews": "3", "rating": "4.50", "description": "Gone . . . running with spirit down the middle of the road . . . a knuckle bump from her coach still fresh in her mind.

Heart and soul - Come Back Strong has the heart of a bittersweet love story and the soul of an athlete's triumph. While reading this true story of a woman's unexpected journey, be prepared to smile, laugh, tear up, and cheer. First a 64 year old woman is flattened by bad news and endures a hard year - her husband\u2019s lung cancer. Then one year later she's up again unexpectedly transformed, ninety pounds thinner and an athlete. Different than other books about life-changing events, Come Back Strong, a Widow\u2019s Song invites the reader to follow a positive path - exercise, nutrition, friendship, challenge, and the power of endorphins. \u201cWalking will clear your mind and lift your spirit,\u201d she told me. The story starts and ends in Presidents Park on an extremely hot Fourth of July morning. A \u201cnewly young\u201d and strong woman is running in her community\u2019s annual 5K. While running, she thinks about the terminal cancer journey she made with her husband, the events of a comeback journey, and changes in her life - facing hard, deserving happiness, losing \u201ccoupleness\u201d, and having a coach for the first time in her life. \u201cIronic. Of all times in my life.\u201d The heartfelt part of the book is the love story of a couple's final days together. Not sad or happy but positively happy and positively sad, a determined couple spend their days working hard to be happy in spite of the massive cancer in his chest. From the first \"it doesn't look good\" from the family doctor to the final days in palliative care, the couple lived with what the author calls a special sass (spirit, attitude, stubbornness, and strength). \u201cWe\u2019ll fight it. Fight it hard!\u201d Then he was gone. The author had left her own health go during the stress and dread of his sickness. She found herself sad-eyed, \"fat\", and unhealthy. A grief counselor challenged her to find the mind-body connection and use movement to quiet her mind, change her body, and pop her spirit. The clumsy non-athlete would meet an understanding but tough trainer and build an unlikely bond with the young man she laughingly names \u201cSheriff\u201d. Slowly he teaches her what she needs to know and coaches her to compete as an athlete. With a touch of her special sass they work together to physically change her body and return her to happiness again. \u201cIf you embarrass me I\u2019m out of here.\u201d Written for those painfully aware of loss but appealing to all who like a warm story about an unlikely friendship, Come Back Strong, a Widow's Song is thoughtful, warm, and powerful. \u201cGood to see up.

In 1857, St. Louis has become a bustling center of transportation and commerce. But the divisions that threaten to tear the nation apart simmer just below the placid surface of daily life. Prosperous merchant and slaveowner Comyn Carvel and his daughter Virginia make no secret of their love for the Southern way of life, or their willingness to fight for it. Meanwhile, a young lawyer from Boston, Stephen Brice, arrives in St. Louis and is soon transformed by his encounters with the horrors of slavery \u2014and with the Republican Party's rising star, Abraham Lincoln.

It combines an engaging narrative, stories from people's lives, and research-informed exercises and worksheets designed to help you cultivate a rich sense of meaning and purpose. Written by Dr. Gleb Tsipursky, this workbook draws on the author's scholarship on meaning and purpose and his experience as a science popularizer and volunteer President of Intentional Insights. Tsipursky will donate most of the profit to Intentional Insights, a nonprofit devoted to empowering people to refine and reach their goals by providing research-based content to help improve thinking, feeling, and behavior patterns.  \"With his warm, engaging, and vulnerable style, Dr. Tsipursky shares his own personal struggle, and that of many others, to reconcile the world of science and reason with the more elusive and subtle pingings of the human heart - to create a life that is larger than oneself,\" wrote Brandon Peele, purpose coach and Founder of PlanetPurpose and EVR1 Institute. \"Dr. Tsipursky shows how modern research in fields such as cognitive psychology and neuroscience provide demonstrable strategies that allow us to create a purpose - our own purpose,\" according to Dr. Bo Bennett, a Doctor of Psychology and author of Logically Fallacious. Those who read draft versions gained much from their experience. \"Its research-based strategies for evaluating one's purpose and meaning have helped me develop a clearer vision for my future. I am currently pursuing a new set of goals - both personally and professionally - that align with my values,\" in the words of John Johnson.  Science really can answer life's big questions, such as \"why am I here,\" as shown by a wave of recent research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and medicine. The research highlights that such questions are vital, since people who lack a rich sense of purpose have significantly worse mental and physical health. The vast majority of guidance on meaning and purpose comes from traditional sources such as cultural heritage and religion. While this guidance works for some, unfortunately traditional sources of meaning and purpose do not speak nearly so well to others who want an evidence-based approach in which they can be truly confident. This workbook offers science-based strategies and data-driven tools to help you improve your mental and physical health by finding the meaning of your life and thus living with a purpose.

Somewhere between routine discipline with horsewhips, gun-waving gambling debt collectors, and LSD-laced breakfast cereal adventures, tragedy strikes a blow from which Jules may never recover.  Jules's story alternates with that of her grandfather, Szaja, an Orthodox Jew who survives the murderous Ukranian pogroms of the 1920s, the Majdanek death camp, and the torpedoing of the Mefkura, a ship carrying refugees to Palestine. Unable to deal with the horrors he endures at the camp, Szaja develops a dissociative disorder and takes on the persona of a dead soldier from a burial ditch, using that man's thoughts to devise a plan to escape to America. While Szaja's and Jules's sorrows are different on the surface, adversity requires them both to find the will to live despite the suffering in their lives--and both encounter, in their darkest moments, what could be explained as serendipity or divine intervention. For Jules and Szaja, these experiences offer the hope they need to come to the rescue of their own fractured lives.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Coming Of Age", "New Adult", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "Drama", "Young Adult"]}, "25204207": {"bookid": "25204207", "title": "The Mindful Lifestyle", "author": "Gary  Green", "series": "", "ratings": "8", "reviews": "4", "rating": "4.38", "description": "The self-help and inspirational book The Mindful Lifestyle describes mindfulness practices in detail, with the idea that everyone can benefit by learning and practicing mindfulness meditation.

Almost miraculously, he recaptures \u201cnormal.\u201d Read how he does it in this award-winning story of survival.PREFACE: The world we live in has the best doctors and the most advanced medical system that our civilization has ever known. Yet 100,000 patients die and nine million suffer injury every year. If medical mistakes were a disease, it would be the sixth leading cause of deaths in America. In this extraordinary age of medical miracles, patients continue to sink into the quicksand of \"going to the hospital.\" Who has not heard about someone who checked into a facility for \"normal\" surgery ... leading to their death? A cartoon makes a joke out of it. It shows a doctor in a laboratory, surrounded by white lab rats. \"We don't need better medicine,\" he announces to his colleagues, \"we need stronger lab rats.\" As you read Warrior Patient you become one of the nine million who suffer injury every year. You take an extraordinary, often amusing journey into the quicksand of modern medicine. In the midst of a long list of life-threatening illnesses, you learn to laugh and you learn how to become a much stronger lab rat, a \"Warrior Patient.\" You take advantage of America's fabulous medical system. You are not taken advantage of by that system.

H\nIn a riveting firsthand account, Emy Cajipe recounts her experience surviving Super Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated the city of Tacloban and surrounding areas in November 2013. Beginning with a snapshot of her childhood in the Philippines, Emy paints a picture of the country she knew when it was still whole and beautiful, with its social complexities and lush landscape. Her spellbinding story parallels her struggle in the days following Haiyan with the experience of her family in the United States as they search and wait for her return.

This will change the way you see the world.   About the Author:  After Super Typhoon Haiyan ripped through the Philippines in 2013, Emy Cajipe chronicled the devastation and chaos that followed. A Filipina by birth, Emy had been living in the United States for forty years when she returned to her hometown near Tacloban on a mission trip to rebuild a local church and help the impoverished youth of the area. When the massive storm surge made landfall near them, Emy witnessed days of absent government relief and harrowing accounts of desperate individuals struggling to survive in the aftermath of the greatest typhoon of her lifetime. Visible Darkness is an intimate portrait of one of the eleven million affected by Haiyan and a raw tale of the tenuous nature of survival and the strength of love.\n", "genres": []}, "23044108": {"bookid": "23044108", "title": "Siren's Song", "author": "S.A.

In 2002, Former NBA owner Donald Sterling acquired the Ardmore Apartments in mid-Wilshire Los Angeles, California where Kandynce Jones was living for many years before the acquisition. Kandynce Jones, a Black woman who was legally blind, right side paralyzed due to a bad spinal fusion surgery, and suffered with Sickle Cell Anemia was living peacefully in her apartment until Donald Sterling realize she was Black. As the building management started to change due to the acquisition, overt cruelty towards African-American and Latino tenants began to be undeniable. News websites like ESPN.com, Huffingtonpost.com, and latimes.com, later shared that when Donald Sterling had first purchased the complex, he made mention of an order, stating that it was \"because all the blacks in the building; they smell, they're not clean...and, it's because of all of the Mexicans that just sit around and smoke and drink all day\" After this, he said, \"So, we have to get them out of here.\" Kandynce Jones and her daughter Ebony Jones decided to take a stand and fight Donald Sterling with no money or big time Attorneys on their side, they took a strong stand against the opposition that threatened to make them feel small and invisible. Ebony wanted to write a memoir that would be honest, upfront, and still give dignity to her mother who died ten years ago. Ebony wrote this story as an example of how you can stand up against all odds even when they are stacked up against you, this story will give you that encouraging word to strengthen and empower you, This is a true story of how a mother and daughter prove that even in the face of insurmountable circumstances; proving that it doesn't really matter who you are or where you come from...Only that you continue to stand and fight against injustice, racism, and cruelty!\"Ebony Jones-Kuye\u2019s autobiography, Stand For Something or Stand For Nothing, is a frank and moving account of her life growing up in the 1970s and '80s in Los Angeles. This nonfiction account reads beautifully, and, at times, I marvelled at the author\u2019s skill in telling her story in such a way that the reader is drawn into everything that happened to her and her mother. I mourned at the news of Chucky\u2019s passing and cheered as Ebony\u2019s intellectual accomplishments were recognized in primary and secondary school. The section of her story that is referred to in the title, namely, the housing battle with Donald Sterling, who essentially denied services to tenants on the grounds of race, reads like a legal thriller. Jones-Kuye states that she wants her story to be an inspiration for others, and, to my mind, she has succeeded brilliantly. Her story is compelling, inspiring and very readable. Stand For Something or Stand For Nothing is most highly recommended (5 Stars).\" -Reviewed By Jack Magnus for Readers Favorite, https://readersfavorite.com/book-revi...\n", "genres": []}, "11392615": {"bookid": "11392615", "title": "Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography", "author": "Theodore Roosevelt", "series": "", "ratings": "1816", "reviews": "153", "rating": "3.90", "description": "Book DescriptionPublication Date: March 24, 2011This book was converted from its physical edition to the digital format by a community of volunteers.

Wat is de merite van zo\u2019n boek waarin een gigantische collectie wereldkunst is opgenomen versus een collectie losse delen?Bladerend door de kunstcollecties, die in themazalen zijn opgedeeld, is het antwoord daar: Het is als wandelen door totaalmusea als the Metropolitan, maar dan met nog meer wijd uitgestrekte vleugels die alle continenten en epoques omspannen.Het Wereldmuseum begint bij het allervroegste begin, vanaf de rotstekeningen van 40.000 tot 14.000 jaar geleden. Op de kunst uit die steentijd volgt de ijstijd met beeldjes en siervoorwerpen uit het bovenpaleolithicum, en dan door naar een nieuwe \u2018zaal\u2019, voor het Oude Nabije Oosten.Vanaf daar is de opdeling verfijnd tot kunstcollecties en stijlen uit Mesopotami\u00eb, Assyri\u00eb, Babylon en negen andere beschavingen. Egypte heeft al een volledige eigen zaal, en die volledigheid loopt door tot op het heden.Het Wereldmuseum is zo letterlijk als het kan. Van de steentijd tot hedendaagse artiesten als Hirst en Hockney, beslaat het boek eveneens alle continenten.Er staan prachtillustraties in van architectonische objecten als de Babylonische Ishtarpoort, de chroomboon van Kapoor uit het Park in Chicago of gietijzeren silhouetten op een strand, waarbij in begeleidende tekst weer verwezen wordt naar een andere pagina over boeddhistische kunst als inspiratiebron van dat kunstwerk.En dan stuit je op handschriften met ja\u00efnistische teksten, een rococozaal in Versailles, iconografie in Rusland of de impressionisten. Zulke collecties kom je nooit in \u00e9\u00e9n museum tegen, if ever. Je blijft eindeloos bladeren, lezen, onderzoeken en bewonderen.Het boek is overzichtelijk ingedeeld in vijfentwintig van die kleurgecodeerde \u2018zalen\u2019, waarin per zaal wordt ingegaan op belangrijke topics of tijdperken. Schilderijen, fresco\u2019s, wandtapijten, friezen, foto\u2019s, installaties, video\u2019s, performances, houtsneden, manuscripten en keramiek: in totaal bijna drieduizend kunstwerken.De afgebeelde werken zijn speciaal geselecteerd op relevantie voor de kunstgeschiedenis en als cultureel erfgoed. Alles is voorzien van heldere teksten over de kunst zelf, de artiesten, de periode en de geschiedkundige achtergrond.In het voorwoord wordt met gepaste trots vermeld dat met dit boek de grootste kunstcollectie is bijeengebracht, niet gehinderd door enige fysieke beperking.

As singular and strange as some of the weapons we encounter on these pages are, we learn that similar factors set their evolution in motion. Emlen uses these patterns to draw parallels to the way we humans develop and employ our own weapons, and have since battle began. He looks at everything from our armor and camouflage to the evolution of the rifle and the structures human populations have built across different regions and eras to protect their homes and communities. With stunning black and white drawings and gorgeous color illustrations of these concepts at work, Animal Weapons brings us the complete story of how weapons reach their most outsized, dramatic potential, and what the results we witness in the animal world can tell us about our own relationship with weapons of all kinds.\n", "genres": ["Evolution", "Natural History", "Environment", "Audiobook", "Animals", "Biology", "War", "Nonfiction", "Nature", "History", "Science"]}, "24971241": {"bookid": "24971241", "title": "The Devil's Fool", "author": "Rachel McClellan", "series": "(The Devil Series #1)", "ratings": "2211", "reviews": "250", "rating": "3.88", "description": "Eve's power-hungry witch parents will kill at the slightest insult, and Eve's unwillingness to use her own supernatural abilities is enough to incite them.

A serial killer is butchering women on the streets of Whitechapel. 26-year-old Cate Kingsley is renowned as \u2018The Remover\u2019, so-called for her unique ability to erase unwanted memories via hypnotism. When her cousin Lottie becomes Jack the Ripper\u2019s latest victim, Cate finds herself hired by the Metropolitan Police to help catch their man by hypnotizing witnesses in a bid to source clues to the killer\u2019s next moves. Reunited with her younger sister Emmeline, Cate is anxious to keep the detectives at a distance in case they uncover some dark family secrets. But Emmeline seems different \u2013 a little too blas\u00e9 about Lottie\u2019s death and much too keen on ransacking Cate\u2019s home. Cate fears Emmy is working as a prostitute in the Ripper's haunts, but do her sister's secrets run deeper than she\u2019s letting on? As the death toll grows on London\u2019s streets, Emmeline vanishes. Ever protective, Cate ups her game and employs a rival hypnotist, Lupin, as her teacher. She is getting closer to finding her sister and revealing the Ripper, but is Lupin helping her or hypnotizing her? Why can\u2019t she remember the letters she burned? And what was Emmeline hunting for before she disappeared?

Couples therapist Resmaa Manakem challenges couples not to avoid conflict\u2014Don\u2019t be afraid to rock the boat! The emotional transformation that results can forge a greater, more mature intimacy; a deeper trust; and a stronger bond.Conflict is a natural part of any intimate relationship. Yet most couples either avoid it or try to smooth over their differences. This results in at least one partner compromising their integrity\u2014and stunting their own growth. Gritty, often irreverent, and always practical, Rock the Boat challenges couples not to flee from conflicts, because the emotional stalemate that conflicts produce creates an opportunity for profound transformation. This transformation affirms each partner\u2019s individuality while forging a more mature intimacy, a greater trust, and a deeper bond. Rock the Boat challenges the idea that conflict between partners is unhealthy or something to avoid. Instead, it encourages both people to stand by what they need and who they are\u2014but to do so with compassion rather than competitiveness or vengefulness. This is the purpose of an intimate relationship: to create an atmosphere where both people learn to grow up and mature in their relationship by appreciating each other\u2019s individual needs in a caring and mature way. Author Resmaa Menakem, a licensed clinical social worker specializing in couples therapy, addresses key factors in making this happen, including accepting discomfort and uncertainty; honesty and openness about sex, money, kids, and in-laws; recognizing when conflict might escalate into violence or abuse; and, when appropriate, finding and working with a good therapist. Rock the Boat is not about ideals, or what we hope or imagine relationships to be. It's an honest, unflinching look at what actually works.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Relationships"]}, "12891107": {"bookid": "12891107", "title": "King of Thorns", "author": "Mark  Lawrence", "series": "(The Broken Empire #2)", "ratings": "60455", "reviews": "2913", "rating": "4.19", "description": "The second book in the Broken Empire series, Lawrence takes his young anti-hero one step closer to his grand ambition.To reach greatness you must step on bodies, and many brothers lie trodden in my wake.

Jim entered medical school in 1981 with his sights set on a career as a \"country doctor,\" catering to those with limited access to quality health care. Within one year, he was diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor. What followed was an odyssey of dealing with the health care system and its practitioners, the increasing limitations and challenges of his disease, and his own mortality staring him in the face.\n", "genres": []}, "26524273": {"bookid": "26524273", "title": "It Happened on Munger Street: A Spiritual Journey Into Awakening", "author": "Victoria Hartland", "series": "", "ratings": "5", "reviews": "0", "rating": "4.60", "description": "This book was written so the experience could be shared and not forgotten.

We were total strangers on this dating site, but when he wrote back a few days later, we began an online conversation that would last over three years. Samuel led me down a new path spiritually that would eventually change the course of my life. The experience was amazing!This book will take you on an inspirational spiritual journey of a single mother still lost after a painful divorce in 2002 and how she and her two children learned to cope and eventually begin again. It's said that people come into and out of our lives for a reason. I have taken those words rather lightly over the years, not fully understanding their profound meaning. But it's true; people come into our lives, it seems, right when we need them the most. How does this happen, and who sends them? Why do they send them? Samuel guided me to a better existence, never asking for anything in return. Who does that for a perfect stranger?

As the incredible opportunity unfolds, Sarah finds herself smitten with the technology, as well as with the project\u2019s lead engineer. Even with the contrast of taking care of her Alzheimer\u2019s-ridden father, it all seems like a dream-come-true for Sarah. That is, until she abruptly learns that she may now be unwittingly mired in a dangerous ruse of international deception, and that the man she\u2019s fallen for, as well as this new, highly transformative technology may originate from somewhere else, other than Earth.Part 2: MatterSarah\u2019s world is further thrown into chaos and confusion when she wakes up with little memory of her recent past and is told that she is a victim of severe brain injury brought on by the very technology she had been working with. Sarah is lost in the revelation, loath to accept the reality being told her, and soon falls into a downward spiral fueled by a husband she doesn\u2019t remember, along with the abysmal fear that she may actually be losing her mind. What Sarah doesn\u2019t realize is that as she fights to gain a hold on what is real, others are in the process of risking their lives in a desperate attempt to free her from her perceptual prison. Filled with guilt, the very man who blames himself for Sarah\u2019s cerebral incarceration begins to work with a group of highly trained professionals who might just be Sarah\u2019s only hope of ever returning to her real life.Tags: Smartphone/Brain Computer Interface, Consumer, Technology, Virtual Worlds, Artificial Telepathy, Neural Streaming, Auxiliary, Senses, Brain Hacking, Ruse, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Mind Control, Artificially-Viable Transhuman Realities, Avatars, Human Trafficking, Streamplaces, Dreams, Purpose, Romance, Adventure, EnvironmentA 2-part Novel in one Volume2nd EditionPrinted pgs. - 496Smartbrain Universe-and the Penchant SeriesSmartbrain, a two-part novel and the first in the Penchant Series, introduces the Reader to a burgeoning, future universe where new, uber-immersive consumer technology creates the potential for worlds of augmented realism that exceeds ordinary, high-definition reality by inestimable measures.Is technology truly leading us to a better world?Will innovation and technology ultimately save our environment from self-induced catastrophe?Are we, because of technology, losing an important part of our humanity?Will this new universe of technology be just another contributor to the separation of the classes?Would technology like this help balance, or destroy world economics?Will we become so dependent on technology that we can no longer survive in the natural world?To what degree, or limit, can technology and biology combine?Can, or will, AI\u2014artificial intelligence\u2014actually supersede human intelligence?Will technology truly help us reach out and colonize the heavens?Will technology enable us to learn that we are not alone in the universe, or ultimately to find out that we are?Technology has already defined an entire new epoch in Earth\u2019s history; will this be the final one?

A young Jewish documentary producer is obsessed with the holocaust story of Bila Tserkva. In 1941, the Germans rounded up and killed the adults and older children. The shooting bothered the soldiers. They had a harder time with the remaining ninety children. The children were held in a building while chaplains and officers took it higher up the chain for a decision on killing the children. The young filmmaker found an old German living in the South with his great niece. He offered to watch the old man during the day if he could interview him. The story leaked out to the young man's friends in Hollywood and a film star was interested. The young man fought to keep them away from what he thought was a story that needed to be told in a factual way. As he interviewed the old German, he got an inside look into the minds of the soldiers as they debated the fate of the children. He got insight into the relationship of two soldiers who were bound together through love and hate. Not even twenty years old, one was a feared killer, the other was an easily dismissed compassionate man. Together, the two Germans fought, killed, drank and debated. The two young men personified the ease and struggle, the pleasure and pain, the horror and delight of hating and killing Jews. All of this came out in the old man's story along with a powerful love story between a German soldier and a beautiful Jewish woman, who was known as \"the woman in the window.\" In the present day, the young filmmaker fell in love with the old German's great niece.

The Excellence Habit is a reminder that you are the owner of your success. There are no magic formulas, shortcuts, or secret sauce. The 7-rules, or 3 steps, or 12 laws that promise to change your life - they won\u2019t help, unless you do the work. You will learn from many, yet the most important steps, you need to take on your own. Over the course of your adult life it is always you, who has the most power. You will not always be in control and nobody is. But you can choose to maximize your effect on this planet, on your loved ones and on your personal fulfillment by building an Excellence Habit. The Excellence Habit also examines the distinction between success and excellence. Success is achieving high goals. Excellence is doing the right thing, even when not driving towards any goal. It is a small mindset shift, which will produce big results. Excellence can and will lead to success. Success, on the other hand, can be the biggest enemy of excellence. More often than not success is measured in social influence, recognition and wealth. For those practicing it faithfully - excellence is its own biggest reward.\n", "genres": ["Self Help", "Psychology", "Business", "Amazon", "Nonfiction"]}, "27117017": {"bookid": "27117017", "title": "Enchanted Castle on the River: Matt's Journey", "author": "Sylvia Abolis Mennear", "series": "", "ratings": "2", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.50", "description": "Matthew is a young teenager about to go camping with his family to a wilderness camp.

If you believe you would survive after Armageddon, you couldn't be further from the truth. Are you knowledgeable on the subject of zombies? Think again. A thrilling first novel that sees a group of survivors struggle against the crazed infected. Marked for death by a clan of vampires, they must decide; is the enemy of my enemy my friend, or should I totally annihilate them both? Be amongst the first to witness the dawn of Dystopian Gothic Realism - a new sub-genre of horror. A post-apocalyptic novel where science-based fact makes for a gothic realism like none you have ever read. Steel yourself and read on. A cure for dementia has disastrously failed. Patients are left crazed, infectious and enraged. The ensuing carnage quickly spreads the disease, and civilisation is decimated by the contamination. On London\u2019s outskirts a military base shelters some survivors. The soldiers within must battle against the infected who now roam unchallenged. Tensions are high, relationships fraught, death commonplace. But if they thought the end of the world was bad enough, their troubles have only just begun. An ancient menace has long existed in secret alongside humanity. Now is their time to emerge from the shadows - a vampire clan has observed the soldiers and has plans for them. First though they have to overcome their own problems. They too have to fight for survival against the infected, and they violently disagree on their approach towards the humans. Hostilities are rising. It's only a matter of time now. Survival of the fittest, after all, is no guarantee. In an uncertain world where life is a privilege not an entitlement, only one thing is certain - there will be blood! Dystopian Gothic Realism is a fresh new look at the horror genre. The zombie is a plausible condition based on medical fact, vampires do not turn into bats but do cast a shadow. After all, the laws of physics are intractable and apply to every creature on earth, living or otherwise. This series of books brings both types of fabled being into the realms of the distinctly plausible. A gritty tale that pits human survivor against the deadliest of foes; and sees both of those face each other in a brutal confrontation.\n", "genres": ["Paranormal", "Thriller", "Zombies", "Horror", "Fantasy", "Vampires"]}, "27396197": {"bookid": "27396197", "title": "Sampling : How to select a good sample: Theory and Techniques of Sampling Design", "author": "Saba Pervez", "series": "", "ratings": "1", "reviews": "0", "rating": "4.00", "description": "Sampling design is an essential tool for business analysts, market researchers, scientists and anyone who needs to use data to conduct hypothesis tests.

No matter how he tried, he could not redirect their attention away from presents and elves to the manger instead.  Glenn didn't want to be the Grinch who spoiled the magic of Kris Kringle, so he had to find a unique way to turn his kids back toward the true meaning of Christmas. He decided the best place to start was by first turning Santa himself back toward Christ.  That was when one of America\u2019s best storytellers began to craft a tale that would change everything his kids thought they knew about Santa\u2014the incredible story he went on to tell them that Christmas Eve spans over a thousand years and explains the meaning behind the immortality and generosity of the man named Claus.

From the snowy mountains of Western Asia, to the deserts of Egypt, to Yemen\u2019s elusive frankincense-bearing boswellia trees, this is an epic tale that gives the legend of Santa a long overdue Christ-centered mission.

T\nThe topic of spiritual health is not a very popular one in most churches today. It is a very sensitive and taboo topic that many church organizations would rather not confront. The records however, show that based on the impact on members\u2019 lives, the differences between healthy and unhealthy churches make this discussion one of paramount importance to the Body of Christ. This is largely so because the scars of spiritual abuse, resulting from spiritual toxicity, can last for a lifetime. The fact is that there are churches that spiritually abuse their members. It is a growing trend in Christendom where unhealthy churches have commandeered the lives of millions of followers. Unconditional love is not to be found in these organizations. One has to earn that love and acceptance through performance. Often church leaders would publicly embarrass and threaten members into strict obedience to a legalistic code. This book was written for survivors of spiritual abuse. Much of it recounts the spiritual journey of the author, who spent over two decades as a member of a church recognized internationally as a Christian cult. There are millions of believers who have fallen through the cracks of Christendom and need to hear a healing word of comfort. It was written for them before they reach their breaking point. Many of them drift along aimless and godless. This book is divided into three sections: Section 1 discusses several criteria by which spiritual health can be assessed. Section 2 offers hope and some good news for survivors of spiritual abuse. It discusses the process of: coming to grips with the effects of spiritual abuse, departing such organizations, and seeking redress from unhealthy, abusive church experiences. These are necessary steps on the road towards recovery and wholeness of the inner person. Section 3 is a question and answer section, where frequently asked questions on the issues surrounding spiritual health and spiritual abuse are answered. Our hope and prayer for survivors of spiritual abuse; both the abused and their perpetrators, within the Body of Christ is for them to heed the words of Jesus, as He calls them to lay down the heavy burdens of religious legalism, and find rest, healing and acceptance in Him (Matthew 11:28-31). For it is in Him and Him alone, that true spiritual fulfilment can and must be found. \n", "genres": []}, "105": {"bookid": "105", "title": "Chapterhouse: Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert", "series": "(Dune #6)", "ratings": "54487", "reviews": "1347", "rating": "3.91", "description": "Alternate Cover Edition of ISBN 0441102670.The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed.

There is advice for people who are just starting out and for people who are in the middle of it. As a successful entrepreneur myself, I agreed with most of the points made, whether it's about how to view the world, trying to understand what people's motives are, or how to differentiate between being confident and being arrogant. The book finishes off by explaining what to do when you have been successful, and that's the part that spoke to me the most. I recommend this book as a blueprint, outline or road map to a successful life. - Allen Wong / Rego AppsThe Third Circle Theory is a modern, eloquent & beautifully systematic answer to life's biggest question. Never before have I seen a literary piece combine such a high level of consciousness with functional, step-by-step business building strategy. Pieces like this are satisfying as an entrepreneur because we know we will look back 30 (and more) years from now and recognize with a smile that this was the beginning of a new generation unlocking new levels of consciousness within themselves. The Third Circle Theory garners my highest endorsement and it is my firm conviction that it is a \"must read\" for every entrepreneur. - Chris McCann / Outlier AcademyWhat if you could take full control of your circumstance, society, and life in the next 30 days?The rules of entrepreneurship have changed. While most books in the world of business and entrepreneurship will teach you about various 'new' methods to becoming successful, they unfortunately don't teach you why only 2% succeed while the other 98% fail. The Third Circle Theory was created to help you understand the key role that your observations play in your success and will enable you to re-live your own life and rediscover what traits, skills, and observations are critical to your success. More importantly this book will help you discover how to tweak your very belief and habit system instantaneously in order to significantly increase your chances of success regardless of which field you undertake. Each circle is designed to help you understand how to stay in control of your emotions and circumstance as you undertake your entrepreneurial journey. Everyone of us is born into a circumstance which we do not control, but all of us are able to take control and alter that circumstance in order to build a strong foundation for ourselves. Regardless that we are born poor or rich, we are can master the 8 components in Circle 1 to progress to a successful state of mind and undertake the challenges that society has created for us. Circle 2 teaches us how to adapt and benefit from other systems and concepts we interact with daily through 6 different components. Our pursuit of wealth and freedom can only take us so far but it is ultimately our drive to define our purpose in life that keeps us motivated. Circle 3 enables us to understand how we create fulfillment for ourselves and define our legacy through entrepreneurship. Understand how your belief controls your perspective and how to control it to create the outcomes you want.When most say \"dream big\", we'll teach you why dreaming leads straight to failure.Discover how confidence and skills lead to the creation of passion and vision.Uncover how most people, even entrepreneurs, are stuck in the rat race and don't even know it. Learn to escape the mundane.Learn to manipulate your environment to maximize wealth, rather than to become a by-product of it.Understand the new rules of entrepreneurship based on today's new global marketplace.This book is for ANYONE who believes they are worth more than they have today, and never want to settle for anything less but their goals.\n", "genres": ["Self Help", "Psychology", "Nonfiction", "Business", "Entrepreneurship", "Philosophy", "Personal Development"]}, "433281": {"bookid": "433281", "title": "Racism without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States", "author": "Eduardo Bonilla-Silva", "series": "", "ratings": "2963", "reviews": "267", "rating": "4.25", "description": "The first edition of this best-selling book showed that alongside the subtle forms of discrimination typical of the post-Civil Rights era, new powerful ideology of \"color-blind racism\" has emerged.

It inaugurates a new intellectual order by realizing the much talked about and hyped but still awaited joining of science and God; reason and faith; physics and metaphysics. It proposes a new hypothesis that borders science and imagination. This work is a serious confluence of physics, philosophy, metaphysic. Theosophy and theology written with a pen, which is youthful and bubbly. Jampak Zu, the virtual cartoon character who has co-authored this book with Kartikey is an innovation in itself. The work brings out seven levels of reality that constitute the cosmic existence. Human existence participates in all of them. It lists the seven important parameters of reality and establishes a canonical inter-relationship between them all. Laws of physics are then extrapolated into the realm of non-physical world using these inter-parametric relations. The seven parameters work like seven interconnected knobs. By turning their values, the reader is made to undergo a journey from one world to another. At the climax of analysis, the reader finds himself in the world of God. The ultimate reality reveals itself automatically and spontaneously with a pleasant surprise that even God does not violate the laws of physics. We see Him through the lens of physics. About The Author: Kartikey is a civil servant by profession, engineer by education and philosopher-metaphysicist by calling. He is an avid reader, writer and speaker in the field of what is called 'new age spirituality'. He has served in various capacities under Ministry of Culture & Tourism, Government of India.

The author alerts us to the existence of an intelligent force that moves everything in the universe, and to the fact that suddenly anything in our lives can change.  With her mind completely lost after a troubled life, Susana decides to travel to India where she is charmed and somehow feels reborn into a new life. Her experiences in the main religious centres of Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism; a meeting with the Dalai Lama; and a whirlwind of emotions that cause her immense inner suffering, motivate her to improve herself spiritually.  Meanwhile, Susana meets her twin soul who ends up leaving her. But fate is pragmatic, insisting on coincidences and discreetly pointing the way to Africa. The action of this story takes place amid the bustle and smells of India, the magic of Africa and chaos of a Portugal submerged in financial crisis.  Yoga and Transcendental Meditation appear as an escape from reality by the author who lives immersed in an ocean of existential questions.  The answers to all these questions come to her through karmic astrology, past life regression and two trips to Uganda. Finally, Susana returns to India where meets her Guru who invites her to plunge deeper into Transcendental Meditation and to see the Divinity.  This book tells a wonderful story that is not just a story of life guided by delivery and abandonment, love and loneliness, altruism and disappointment. This story is also about self-knowledge, Karma, Dharma, Faith and evolution of the soul.

Memory is dangerous in a country built to function on national amnesia. A single act of public remembrance might expose the frailty of the state's carefully constructed edifice of accepted history, one kept aloft by strict censorship, blatant falsehood, and willful forgetting. Though the consequences of Tiananmen Square are visible everywhere throughout China, what happened there has been consigned to silence. In The People's Republic of Amnesia, NPR's China correspondent Louisa Lim offers an insider's account of this seminal tragedy, revealing the enormous impact it had on China and the reverberations still felt today. Official hypocrisy and the government's obsession with maintaining stability and silence have deepened June 4th's impact on the nation's psyche. Lim interweaves portraits of eight individuals whose lives have been shaped by June 4--including the two women who started Tiananmen Mothers, one of the first and most prominent grassroots organizations outside the Chinese government's control; a student survivor involved in the protests; a soldier who took part in the suppression; and a high-ranking government administrator who played a role in ordering the tanks into the square. In the process she offers a textured, intimate, and haunting look at the national tragedy and an unhealed wound.\n", "genres": ["Cultural", "Journalism", "Politics", "Asia", "Asian Literature", "Literature", "Writing", "Social Science", "Historical", "China", "Nonfiction", "World History", "History"]}, "30365170": {"bookid": "30365170", "title": "Impending Earth", "author": "J.R.

It is this pride, this lack of both internal and external consciousness, that demanded we flee for our very lives, and this is the story I will relate to you now. My name is Dyzek, my three companions and I come from the planet Marmara in the Copetus galaxy. At one time, many, many moons ago, all of the peoples of Marmara were free, or so we thought, which resulted in our need to escape the impending oppression. I record these truths for those of the future, my \u2018children\u2019. The four of us, my \u2018family\u2019, desire for those who will come after us and inhabit this new found world, we call \u201cEarth\u201d, to learn of this murderous pride which occupies the heart and soul of every being in our species.

He added, \"She is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying herself or in suborning lying in her aides and friends.\" This new book by James Beresford, with its hard-punching facts and the personal testimonies\u00a0of people close to the Clintons, may be the last chance for rational thinkers in America to call\u00a0Hillary\u00a0to account, and stem the litany\u00a0of lies that has become her legacy.\u00a0And Beresford serves up a plethora of\u00a0reasons why her Presidency of the United States would be an utter disaster.Hillary Clinton: A Legacy of Lies brings into sharp focus how the Clintons have, by their unsavoury morals and perfidious, self-serving actions, created a new standard for younger generations in their understanding of what is right and wrong.\u00a0Beresford\u00a0believes that William Safire's use of the word \"congenital\" was misapplied\u00a0since congenital implies something derived from birth\u2014a sickness if you will.

But I could just as easily write a book on Donald Trump and why he, too, cannot be trusted.\"This book is of course one person's opinion.

In a fit of preemptive grief and magical thinking, she sets out for a hike in the Galilee, leaving no forwarding information for the \u201cnotifiers\u201d who might darken her door with the worst possible news. Recently estranged from her husband, Ilan, she drags along an unlikely companion: their former best friend and her former lover Avram, once a brilliant artistic spirit. Avram served in the army alongside Ilan when they were young, but their lives were forever changed one weekend when the two jokingly had Ora draw lots to see which of them would get the few days\u2019 leave being offered by their commander\u2014a chance act that sent Avram into Egpyt and the Yom Kippur War, where he was brutally tortured as POW. In the aftermath, a virtual hermit, he refused to keep in touch with the family and has never met the boy. Now, as Ora and Avram sleep out in the hills, ford rivers, and cross valleys, avoiding all news from the front, she gives him the gift of Ofer, word by word; she supplies the whole story of her motherhood, a retelling that keeps Ofer very much alive for Ora and for the reader, and opens Avram to human bonds undreamed of in his broken world. Their walk has a \u201cwar and peace\u201d rhythm, as their conversation places the most hideous trials of war next to the joys and anguish of raising children. Never have we seen so clearly the reality and surreality of daily life in Israel, the currents of ambivalence about war within one household, and the burdens that fall on each generation anew.

Then they became the Tr\u00fcmmerfrauen, or Rubble Women, as they cleared and tidied their ruined country to get it back on its feet. They were Germany's heroines. The few women tried and convicted after the war were simply the evil aberrations - the camp guards, the female Nazi elite - that proved this rule.However, Wendy Lower's research into the very ordinary women who went out to the Nazi Eastern Front reveals an altogether different story. For ambitious young women, the emerging Nazi empire represented a kind of Wild East of career and matrimonial opportunity. Over half a million of them set off for these new lands, where most of the worst crimes of the Reich would occur.Through the interwoven biographies of thirteen women, the reader follows the transformation of young nurses, teachers, secretaries and wives who start out in Weimar and Nazi Germany as ambitious idealists and end up as witnesses, accomplices and perpetrators of the genocide in Ukraine, Poland and Belarus. Hitler's Furies presents overwhelming evidence that the women in these territories actively participated in the mass murder - and some became killers. In the case of women like Erna Petri, who brought her family to her husband's impressive Polish SS estate, we find brutality as chilling as any in history.Hitler's Furies is indelible proof that we have not known what we need to know about the role of women in the Nazi killing fields - or about how it could have been hidden for seventy years. It shows that genocide is women's business as well as men's and that, in ignoring women's culpability, we have ignored the reality of the Holocaust.\n", "genres": ["Cultural", "Holocaust", "Germany", "Womens", "World War II", "Historical", "Audiobook", "Nonfiction", "History", "Biography", "War"]}, "8779896": {"bookid": "8779896", "title": "The Monkey's Paw", "author": "W.W.

Beginning in my middle school years, the novel weaves its way through the '90s to present day, as the stress of exceeding expectations of what it means to be a black male and the crippling unspoken belief that says (without saying) - it's impossible for a man to be raped - has forced one mental breakdown after another, resulting in thoughts of suicide. This memoir is filled with depth, humor, and honesty about the reality and myth of what it means to be a black male (not all of us can handle a basketball or football), while explaining the burden and responsibility each assigned title has had on my life, the way I prepare my seventh grade students to enter the world, and the way my shattered thoughts have forced me to interact.

In this compelling memoir, his first wife, Jane Hawking, relates the inside story of their extraordinary marriage. As Stephen's academic renown soared, his body was collapsing under the assaults of a motor neuron disease. Jane's candid account of trying to balance his 24-hour care with the needs of their growing family reveals the inner strength of the author, while\u00a0the self-evident character and achievements of her husband make for an incredible tale presented with unflinching honesty.\u00a0Jane's candor is no less apparent when the marriage finally ends in a high-profile meltdown, with Stephen leaving Jane for one of his nurses and\u00a0Jane marrying an old family friend. In this exceptionally open, moving, and often funny memoir, Jane Hawking confronts not only the acutely complicated and painful dilemmas of her first marriage, but also the relationship's\u00a0fault lines exposed by the pervasive effects of fame and wealth.

Kesi of Giza, young and new, the hybrid blood drinker from Book One had documented her life as the child of the Pet Mer, gods from the sky, worshiped and protected by Pharaoh, offered their blood by humans. But all was not perfect, and Kesi documents her struggles, fears and trials for which future generations can learn. She may be a child of a unique race, but her struggles growing into womanhood are easily related even today as she learns of her place in a strange world, what it is to be different, coming to terms with her ever maturing body, her first love, and her need to have children\u2014learned by catching another hybrid in the process. But success is not as effortless as she hopes and her life is thrown into a sand storm of despair as she is put to trial for deaths not of her own making and forced into a loveless marriage of convenience as punishment.

It offers a detailed historical account of being a Jewish teenager under the Nazi regime, shedding light on sickening truths in an honest, matter-of-fact way.Hank Brodt (b. 1925) lived through one of the darkest periods of human history and survived the devastation of World War II. Born into a poor family in Boryslaw (Poland), he was placed in a Jewish orphanage. Losing his whole family when the Germans invaded Poland, he waged a daily battle to survive. Moving from forced labor camps to concentration camps, one of which features in Schindler\u2019s List, his world behind the barbed wire consisted of quiet resistance, invisible tears and silent cries for years on end.This story of survival includes rare photographs from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum that powerfully illustrate these intimate and shocking memoirs. One recently discovered picture shows Hank Brodt in prison uniform removing the dead on carts at the liberated Ebensee concentration camp on May 7, 1945.It is hard to believe that someone who endured such horrific events could go on to live a life of gratitude. Through his unwavering compassion towards others, Hank Brodt managed to keep his humanity and find a way to move forward.After the Second World War, Hank Brodt testified at the trial of Nazi war criminal Amon Goeth in Dachau, Germany. He has joined the March of the Living since 2006, walking from Auschwitz to Birkenau on Yom Hashoah to pay tribute to the millions that died. Lighting the candle, he made a promise to himself to always answer the call to talk.Hank Brodt\u2019s Holocaust memoirs are a necessary reminder of one of the ugliest times in the history of human civilization.\n", "genres": ["Holocaust", "Autobiography", "World War II", "Historical", "Nonfiction", "Memoir", "War"]}, "30201678": {"bookid": "30201678", "title": "An Invitation to the Table: Embracing the Gift of Hospitality", "author": "Michelle Lazurek", "series": "", "ratings": "8", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.00", "description": "", "genres": []}, "32451853": {"bookid": "32451853", "title": "SeQuence", "author": "Lorraine M.L.M.", "series": "(The Heart of the Ocean #1)", "ratings": "110", "reviews": "52", "rating": "3.61", "description": "", "genres": ["Young Adult Fantasy", "Magic", "Young Adult", "Fantasy", "Romance"]}, "32469209": {"bookid": "32469209", "title": "The Reluctant Trader", "author": "David N.

Using strategies such as analyzing dreams, developing inner dialogue, and keeping a detailed journal, Sacred Selfishness wisely assure us that our lives are sacred tasks, where holiness is love and the way to the Divine is through self-knowledge.Sacred selfishness is valuing ourselves enough to develop into authentic human beings, who give back vitality and hope to all around us. While growing up, unselfishness was usually defined as putting the needs of others above our own. As a result, we became outward-directed people, cut off from our inner source of energy and vitality. If we have failed, through the years, to develop our own individuality, eventually we may slide into depression and ill health. It is only after becoming whole again that we can help others and truly renew our society. In the tradition of Scott Peck's The Road Less Traveled and Thomas Moore's The Care of the Soul, Bud Harris shows us to value and love ourselves, to think for ourselves, to have lives of our own, and to be able to love others without losing ourselves.

They were a sensation both due to his angle of vision - Razgon was living among the Party elites as the Stalinist terror of 1937 began - as well as to his sophisticated understanding of both his country and his century. His remarkably long life took him from the shtetl and a family which had been unlucky with the authorities for many generations, to Moscow where he was a Communist journalist and writer, to 17 years in labor camps (a fate shared by both his wives). When he finally returned to Moscow for good, he went back to writing books for young adults and worked in secret on these memoirs. The last man alive to have actually attended and survived the Communist Party Congress of 1934 - most of those attending were dead within three years - Razgon brilliantly conveys the everyday atmosphere of a Soviet world of privilege about to be destroyed. Stalin had given secret orders that the families and friends of the powerful be decimated as a lesson in terror, a preemptive strike against any thoughts of a coup. In this book the personalities and stories which shaped Razgon's existence before and after his seventeen years in the camps are emphasized. Razgon's journalistic curiosity and interest in history as well as individuals led him in unusual directions. Much here is new: the characters and fates of the jailers; the camp lives of the wives of the Soviet elite, imprisoned as hostages to control their powerful husbands; and the frustration of formerly high-ranking military men, forgotten prisoners of the gulag as they see that World War II is approaching.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction"]}, "30754700": {"bookid": "30754700", "title": "The Game Changers: True Stories About Saving Mothers & Babies In East Africa", "author": "Jean Chamberlain Froese", "series": "", "ratings": "10", "reviews": "4", "rating": "4.10", "description": "The Game Changers is a passionate wake-up call to recognize and rectify a daily tragedy and a global injustice.

At the very beginning of the book, Rasia is in the throes of labor.

The birth of Lucien Cerebus DeSai is nothing but a threat to Rasia, and this interferes with her affection. I had to play up her mothering instincts, and I had to make Cyril\u2019s family dream become her dream as well. Only in this way would she raise Lucien with the iron fist necessary for him to become a capable family head.Writing \u2018Lucien\u2019s Reign\u2019 was a good time; I was able to cut loose in a lot of areas regarding the true enormity of Lucien\u2019s character.

He has evolved into a deadly, silent killer who lives in the shadows, existing in isolation. No one ever sees him or remembers him, and his existence is no more than a legend, whispered in fear by those who he will hunt. He connects with no one\u2026ever\u2026until a hit gone wrong forces him to accept the one assignment he'd never thought he'd take: to save instead of kill.Slade has no concept of mercy, of humanity, of connection, and yet those are exactly what his new charge, Anya Diaz, demands of him. Desperate to save her kidnapped sister, Anya compels Slade to engage emotionally, dragging them both deeper into the twisted, deadly world of the shifter black market. Fierce passion ignites between the two guarded souls, but rising danger threatens to unravel every step they take toward survival. Will the secrets they've both been hiding destroy what little they have left, or will their growing connection empower them to prevail against an enemy far worse than either of them imagined?\n", "genres": ["Paranormal", "Paranormal Romance", "Fantasy", "Shapeshifters", "Romance"]}, "33536074": {"bookid": "33536074", "title": "She Is Without Limits", "author": "Haley Hoffman Smith", "series": "", "ratings": "6", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.67", "description": "Haley Hoffman Smith's debut book, She Is Without Limits, explores the many ways to liberate ourselves from perceived limitations.

This book focuses on the third: the role of U.S. and European churches, academics, think-tanks, foundations, government and human rights groups in fostering separation of the identities of Dravidian and Dalit communities from the rest of India. The book is the result of five years of research, and uses information obtained in the West about foreign funding of these Indian-based activities. The research tracked the money trails that start out claiming to be for \"education,\" \"human rights,\" \"empowerment training,\" and \"leadership training,\" but end up in programs designed to produce angry youths who feel disenfranchised from Indian identity. The book reveals how outdated racial theories continue to provide academic frameworks and fuel the rhetoric that can trigger civil wars and genocides in developing countries. The Dravidian movement's 200-year history has such origins. Its latest manifestation is the \"Dravidian Christianity\" movement that fabricates a political and cultural history to exploit old faultlines. The book explicitly names individuals and institutions, including prominent Western ones and their Indian affiliates. Its goal is to spark an honest debate on the extent to which human rights and other \"empowerment\" projects are cover-ups for these nefarious activities.

LIMITED TIME OFFER!<<<\n Our hyper connected world bombards us with images of phenomenally successful celebrities together with the expectation that we should want nothing but the best for ourselves at all times. But in a bustling world of 7 billion people, carving out a meaningful niche for ourselves can be daunting to say the least.  It's understandable that people feel the need to bolster their self esteem. Faced with millions of glossy images in the media about how we should live our lives, some have turned to trying even harder still to keep up. Others have merely given up.  It's no exaggeration that people in the 21st century live in a world of infinitely more possibilities than any generation before them. We have experts and gurus of all stripes telling us that the life we have now is nothing compared to what we could achieve \u2013 and yet, we're as depressed and lacking in confidence as ever.  Self help books on the market today will tell you one of two things: either that you are perfect already as you are and needn't worry, or that with just a little (well, a lot) of effort, you can reach those goals. Be the best, smartest, most successful, thinnest and relentlessly happiest version of yourself possible. No excuses!  This book takes a different approach to self esteem altogether.  If you're feeling overwhelmed and worthless, inundated with information, struggling to juggle life, expectations, and disappointments... it may be time for a little self-compassion.  Unlike self esteem or an inflated confidence level, self-compassion is a different way of looking at yourself and others, warts and all, and a way more realistic acceptance of the way things are.  Healthier than a high self esteem is a realistic, compassionate view of ourselves \u2013 and others. Generating our sense of self-worth from within means we have a more stable self-concept \u2013 one that can endure criticism while still learning from it. One that can honestly appraise who we are as human beings \u2013 and love and respect ourselves anyway. With self-compassion, you become unflappable, calm and self-assured - without the risk of narcissism or becoming self-absorbed.  Through a series of exercises, this book will suggest a new, gentle yet extremely powerful attitude shift that can end feelings of self-hatred, doubt, shame and low self-worth forever.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Nonfiction", "Self Help"]}, "34182070": {"bookid": "34182070", "title": "Evolution: The Series of the Heart", "author": "M a Nevvis", "series": "", "ratings": "1", "reviews": "0", "rating": "5.00", "description": "A Book Of Prose.

He re-lives the disruptions of military family life, family violence, the racism of the Jim Crowe South, and the tidal wave of fear and confusion when exiled to a boarding school in France as a child. With unalloyed frankness, McCormack, an award-winning psychotherapist, author, and lecturer, takes us into the mental illness in his own family, and the destructive influence of his cratered childhood upon his adulthood. During this journey, we go behind the scenes of psychiatric treatment, including a vivid portrayal of McCormack\u2019s experience in psychoanalysis and as a psychiatric social worker in a locked-door inpatient treatment unit. There, we become engulfed in the penetrating horror and self-doubt when confronted with the suicide of several patients, as well as the profound sense of fulfillment experienced when able to help those who had been unable to help themselves. In his striving for happiness and meaning, McCormack arrives at the realization that there was an enduring block to happiness and that it resided within himself. Rejecting this self-limiting fate, he pecks away at the shells that confine him like a Russian nesting doll and discovers first-hand the hidden power of incomplete mourning to constrict happiness like English ivy strangles a tree.

The Nag Hammadi Library, the Gospel of Judas, the mysteries of the Manicheans and the Cathars, the alchemical endeavors of Carl Jung and the terrifying visions of Lovecraft and William Blake \u2013 all sources that he blends together to paint his personal savior.  Lie notices that many things attributed to Jesus in the bible make little sense and decides that the best way to pass his ideas is to offer them as new answers to old problems. By a sleight of hand, he offers shocking, yet convincing, explanations to some of the strangest things attributed to Jesus. We finally know why Jesus cursed the Canaanite woman, rebuked Mary at the wedding of Cana, and uttered his famous cry at the cross: \u2018God why have you forsaken me?\u2019  Lie pretends to adopt the Gnostic exegesis of the bible, which maintains that Jesus was a divine being who descended to the earth to save his fallen lover Sophia. Lie argues that Jesus\u2019 entire mission was one of spiritual wedding and claims that all the women that Jesus encountered in the Gospels were allegorical for Sophia, each representing her in one of the stages of her spiritual development.  And so Lie proceeds, following the steps of Jesus till the moment when the redeemer, crucified, hugs Sophia and submits his spirit in her embrace. A minor mistake, however, reveals the entire work to be the product of his grievance at the loss of his granddaughter. Sadly, it is at this tragic moment that his gospel comes to an abrupt end; for Lie, unable to comprehend the mystery of the resurrection and experience the solace it brings, abandons his draft to finally wither and die.  This could have very well been the end of Lie\u2019s tragic story, were it not for his good friend Fady Riad who discovers the manuscript and takes an oath upon himself to have it completed and published.  \u201cYour book will be finished, and your Jesus will be resurrected.\u201d He promises his friend in a dream.  As Riad studies the draft, however, he soon realizes that it is riddled with various loose ends that make completing it virtually impossible. Nonetheless, Riad doesn\u2019t give up, knowing that there is no price that he won\u2019t pay to honor the legacy of his late friend...\n", "genres": ["Religion"]}, "34763220": {"bookid": "34763220", "title": "Temple of my Heart", "author": "Vatasescu Ana-Irina", "series": "", "ratings": "6", "reviews": "2", "rating": "4.50", "description": "Temple of my heart is a representation of a beautiful love story.

Every human being is a super human being not gifted with super natural powers but blessed with super natural sensory abilities which the majority of human beings never realise about in their lifetime. Everything is in a cycle and getting out of it is oneself's biggest task at hand. The Universal Words discusses those integral words of our common rulebook of nature and its living beings. The book is divided in to two parts, 'The Early Phase' and 'The Culminating Phase' metaphorically explaining the two stages of a human's so-called self-realisation journey. It has 60 medium length poems along with 16 'doha' (couplets) and 7 intersections (short poems) arranged in a manner in which the cycle of an individual's realisation generally takes place from being in an Unknown state to being a Learner to becoming an Observer to understanding deep mysteries of Existence to integrating the Self with That Only Self.
