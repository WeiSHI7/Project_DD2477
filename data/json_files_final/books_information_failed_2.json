Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever. The Rescue When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love. In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.\n", "genres": ["Contemporary Romance", "Drama", "Adult Fiction", "Adult", "Chick Lit", "Audiobook", "Romance", "Love", "Womens Fiction", "Fiction", "Contemporary"]}, "2022885": {"bookid": "2022885", "title": "Heart of Darfur", "author": "Lisa French Blaker", "series": "", "ratings": "140", "reviews": "14", "rating": "3.71", "description": "This is the heart-breakingly honest and tender account of a nurse's struggle to help in the middle of the humanitarian disaster that is Darfur.\nThis is the heart-breakingly honest and tender account of a nurse's struggle to help in the middle of the humanitarian disaster that is Darfur.\n", "genres": ["War", "Sudan", "Memoir", "Africa", "Biography", "Cultural", "Autobiography", "Travel", "Northern Africa", "Nonfiction", "Female Authors"]}, "75020": {"bookid": "75020", "title": "The Romanov Prophecy", "author": "Steve Berry", "series": "", "ratings": "23686", "reviews": "1158", "rating": "3.94", "description": "Ekaterinburg, Russia: July 16, 1918.

Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866\u20131944), it explains Kandinsky's own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings, this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.Kandinsky's ideas are presented in two parts. The first part, called \"About General Aesthetic,\" issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract, non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music, so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part, \"About Painting,\" Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors, the language of form and color, and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator, Michael T. H. Sadler, offers additional explanation of Kandinsky's art and theories, while a new Preface by Richard Stratton discusses Kandinsky's career as a whole and the impact of the book. Making the book even more valuable are nine woodcuts by Kandinsky himself that appear at the chapter headings.This English translation of \u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst was a significant contribution to the understanding of nonobjectivism in art. It continues to be a stimulating and necessary reading experience for every artist, art student, and art patron concerned with the direction of 20th-century painting.\n", "genres": ["Writing", "Art Design", "Art", "Philosophy", "Classics", "Religion", "Spirituality", "Design", "Essays", "Art History", "Nonfiction"]}, "381421": {"bookid": "381421", "title": "Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence", "author": "Sarah  Young", "series": "", "ratings": "65600", "reviews": "1456", "rating": "4.47", "description": "After many years of writing her own words in her prayer journal, missionary Sarah Young decided to be more attentive to the Savior's voice and begin listening for what He was saying.

Together with these essential new articles, the selections by Peter Berger, Herbert Gans, Erving Goffman, Donna Eder, Zella Luria, C.

This works also thoroughly investigates the threats on the president\u2019s life before travelling to Texas; the presence of unauthorized Secret Service agents in Dealey Plaza, the site of the assassination; the failure of the Secret Service in monitoring and securing the surrounding buildings, overhangs, and rooftops; and the surprising conspiratorial beliefs of several former agents.

Her story is like Mother Teresa\u2019s in that she has given up everything\u2014at such a young age\u2014to care for the less fortunate of this world. Katie, a charismatic and articulate young woman, has gone on to adopt 14 children during her time in Uganda, and she completely trusts God for daily provision for her and her family, which includes children with special needs. To further her reach into the needs of Ugandans, Katie established Amazima Ministries. The ministry matches orphaned children with sponors worldwide. Each sponsor's $300/year provides schooling, school supplies, three hot meals a day, minor medical care, and spiritual encouragement. Katie expected to have forty children in the program; she had signed up 150 by January 2008; today it sponsors over 400. Another aspect of the ministry is a feeding program created for the displaced Karamojong people\u2014Uganda's poorest citizens. The program feeds lunch to over 1200 children Monday-Friday and sends them home with a plate for food; it also offers basic medical care, Bible study, and general health training.Katie Davis, now 21, is more than fascinating, she's inspiring, as she has wholeheartedly answered the call to serve.\n", "genres": ["Adoption", "Memoir", "Africa", "Biography", "Christian", "Cultural", "Inspirational", "Religion", "Autobiography", "Christianity", "Biography Memoir", "Faith", "Parenting", "Nonfiction"]}, "2207435": {"bookid": "2207435", "title": "Debbie Harry Sings in French", "author": "Meagan Brothers", "series": "", "ratings": "947", "reviews": "134", "rating": "3.71", "description": "Johnny\u2019s had kind of a tough life so far, and he\u2019s always been a bit of a freak.

With their broad canvas and large cast of fictional and historical characters, the novels in this series present a panorama of the American political and imperial experience as interpreted by one of its most worldly, knowing, and ironic observers.To most Americans, Abraham Lincoln is a monolithic figure, the Great Emancipator and Savior of the Union, beloved by all. In Gore Vidal's Lincoln we meet Lincoln the man and Lincoln the political animal, the president who entered a besieged capital where most of the population supported the South and where even those favoring the Union had serious doubts that the man from Illinois could save it. Far from steadfast in his abhorrence of slavery, Lincoln agonizes over the best course of action and comes to his great decision only when all else seems to fail. As the Civil War ravages his nation, Lincoln must face deep personal turmoil, the loss of his dearest son, and the harangues of a wife seen as a traitor for her Southern connections.

One moment Josh Sundquist was your typical energetic and inquisitive nine year- old boy. The next, his entire life changed when he was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a particularly virulent cancer strain that would eventually claim Josh's left leg. Told in a wide-eyed, winning, heartbreaking voice, Just Don't Fall is the story of the boy Josh was and of the young man he became. His story begins in a small, close-knit Southern town, where his father-an aspiring pastor questioning his faith, and his mother-- homeschooling an ever- growing brood of children-struggle to make ends meet. Josh journeys through a dizzying array of hospitals and eventually lands at a pivotal place: the nearby mountain, where he makes his first attempt to ski.  It is on the slopes, and later, on the race course, that Josh's world bursts wide open in a way no one could have ever anticipated. The inspiration to ski, however, and to become a champion, is not all that Josh has to contend with- there is adolescence to navigate, the transition from homeschool to public high school, and girls. There is an increasingly turbulent and difficult home life, with another cancer scare, a wayward brother, and dwindling finances to pay for training. Finally, there is the wild, bumpy road to the Paralympics in Turin, with a misanthropic coach, training in the Rockies, and a timeless friendship with a charismatic, imposing Brooklyn homeboy named Ralph.  Through it all, Josh is forced to question his abilities, his sanity, his will, his faith in himself, and his faith in God. Because of, not despite, these myriad obstacles in his path, Josh is able to achieve a genuine grace: the grace to risk failure and to succeed. It is the grace of a young boy becoming a man and of a champion realizing his greatest dream. Josh Sundquist shows us with charm, humility and remarkable strength that even if we fall, this inner grace can lift us up and carry us over the many mountains we all must face.\n", "genres": ["Memoir", "Biography", "Disability", "Adult", "Inspirational", "Autobiography", "Young Adult", "Coming Of Age", "Sports", "Audiobook", "Nonfiction"]}, "1184484": {"bookid": "1184484", "title": "Wise and Otherwise", "author": "Sudha Murty", "series": "", "ratings": "11053", "reviews": "698", "rating": "4.00", "description": "Fifty vignettes showcase the myriad shades of human natureA man dumps his aged father in an old-age home after declaring him to be a homeless stranger, a tribal chief in the Sahyadri hills teaches the author that there is humility in receiving too, and a sick woman remembers to thank her benefactor even from her deathbed.

But in her quest for mortality, she becomes a pawn in a power struggle between an overzealous archangel and Death Himself.

How hard can changing her future be?But with each changing moment, RJ\u2019s life begins to unravel, until this self-proclaimed queen bee is a social pariah.

My heart, after all, was already broken.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, I thought wryly, glancing up from the all- too-familiar patient room floor at Apollo City Hospital.\n\nBetween the tarnished sense of sterility, its ash-colored tiles, and the dulled-white walls, I almost felt at home. In the last six years, I\u2019d come here at least once every couple of months. Between all my visits, I had counted the cabinets along the wall countless times, even if I always forgot how many there actually were in the end.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing I\u2019d forgotten, either. I frowned at the sudden, overwhelming scent of iodine.\n\nHow long have I been sitting here, to have forgotten that?\n\nI hated that smell. It wasn\u2019t just unpleasant in itself; it also brought up a wide array of unpleasant memories.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Raiya?\u201d\n\nDespite my discomfort, a small, reassuring smile was already on my lips as I looked over at my grandfather. Through the loose tresses of my coppery hair, I saw him watching me with a concerned look on his face.\n\nMy grandpa was a thin man, with a bushy, white beard and kind, ageless eyes. Every day since I\u2019d finished elementary school, it seemed as though he was getting shorter as I was getting taller. As I gazed at him, taking in his plain clothes and his oversized coat, I thought how easy it would be for the average person to dismiss him, to see him as harmless and old, barely indistinguishable from any man walking in the street.\n\nGrandpa would never be that to me.

In a tour de force that could be described as Altmanesque, we are invited into the private lives of the residents of a quiet urban street in England over the course of a single day. In delicate, intricately observed closeup, we witness the hopes, fears, and unspoken despairs of a diverse community: the man with painfully scarred hands who tried in vain to save his wife from a burning house and who must now care for his young daughter alone; a group of young clubgoers just home from an all-night rave, sweetly high and mulling over vague dreams; the nervous young man at number 18 who collects weird urban junk and is haunted by the specter of unrequited love. The tranquillity of the street is shattered at day's end when a terrible accident occurs. This tragedy and an utterly surprising twist provide the momentum for the book.

Two hours after their jump, all but three of these men were dead or mortally burned from a \"blowup\" -- an explosive, 2,000-degree firestorm 300 feet deep and 200 feet tall -- a deadly explosion of flame and wind rarely encountered and little understood at the time.\u00a0 Only seconds ahead of the approaching firestorm, the foreman, R.

The parents of the dead cry murder, charging that the foreman's fire killed their boys.\u00a0 Exactly what happened in Mann Gulch that day has been obscured by years of grief and controversy. Now a master storyteller finally gives the Mann Gulch fire its due as tragedy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These first deaths among the Forest Service's elite firefighters prompted widespread examination of federal fire policy, of the field of fire science, and of the frailty of young men. For Maclean, who witnessed the fire from the ground in August of 1949,\u00a0 and even then he knew he would one day become a part of its story.\u00a0 It is a story of Montana, of the ways of wildfires, firefighters, and fire scientists, and especially of a crew, young and proud, who \"hadn't learned to count the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy.\" This tale is also Maclean's own, the story of a writer obsessed by a strange and human horror, unable to let the truth die with these young men, searching for the last - and lasting - word. A canvas on which to tell many stories, including the story of his research into the story itself. And finally Nature's violence colliding with human fallibility.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Haunted by these deaths for forty years, Norman Maclean returned to the scene with two of the survivors and pursues the mysteries that Mann Gulch has kept hidden since 1949.\u00a0 From the words of witnesses, the evidence of history, and the research of fire scientists, Maclean at last assembles the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy; in his last work that consumed 14 years of his life, and earned a 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The excruciating detail of this book makes for a sobering reading experience.

The time of the novel is the closing months of the most senselessly savage of modern conflicts. In France, millions of men engaged in brutal trench warfare are all \"ghosts in the making.\" In England, psychologist William Rivers, with severe pangs of conscience, treats the mental casualties of the war to make them whole enough to fight again. One of these, Billy Prior, risen to the officer class from the working class, both courageous and sardonic, decides to return to France with his fellow officer, poet Wilfred Owen, to fight a war he no longer believes in. Meanwhile, Rivers, enfevered by influenza, returns in memory to his experience studying a South Pacific tribe whose ethos amounted to a culture of death. Across the gulf between his society and theirs, Rivers begins to form connections that cast new light on his--and our--understanding of war.  Combining poetic intensity with gritty realism, blending biting humor with tragic drama, moving toward a denouement as inevitable as it is devastating, \"The Ghost Road\" both encapsulates history and transcends it.

This is his superb account of his life up until that 'bitter leave-taking': from his childhood and desperately unhappy school days at Charterhouse, to his time serving as a young officer in the First World War that was to haunt him throughout his life. It also contains memorable encounters with fellow writers and poets, including Siegfried Sassoon and Thomas Hardy, and looks at his increasingly unhappy marriage to Nancy Nicholson. Goodbye to All That, with its vivid, harrowing descriptions of the Western Front, is a classic war document, and also has immense value as one of the most candid self-portraits of an artist ever written.Robert Ranke Graves (1895-1985) was a British poet, novelist, and critic. He is best known for the historical novel I, Claudius and the critical study of myth and poetry The White Goddess. His autobiography, Goodbye to All That, was published in 1929, quickly establishing itself as a modern classic. Graves also translated Apuleius, Lucan and Suetonius for the Penguin Classics, and compiled the first modern dictionary of Greek Mythology, The Greek Myths. His translation of The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m (with Omar Ali-Shah) is also published in Penguin Classics.\n", "genres": ["War", "Memoir", "World War I", "Biography", "Classics", "History", "20th Century", "Biography Memoir", "Autobiography", "Literature", "Nonfiction"]}, "22891629": {"bookid": "22891629", "title": "The Motivation Manifesto", "author": "Brendon Burchard", "series": "", "ratings": "5303", "reviews": "429", "rating": "4.00", "description": "\u201cThe Motivation Manifesto is a poetic and powerful call to reclaim our lives and find our own personal freedom.

We desire the grand liberties of choice\u2014time freedom,\u00a0emotional freedom, social freedom, financial freedom, spiritual freedom. Only two enemies stand in\u00a0our way: an external enemy, defined as the social oppression of who we are by the mediocre\u00a0masses, and an internal enemy, a sort of self-oppression caused by our own doubt and fear. The march to Personal Freedom, Burchard argues, can be won only by declaring our intent and\u00a0independence, stepping into our personal power, and battling through self-doubt and the\u00a0distractions of the day until full victory is won. Recalling the revolutionist voices of the past that\u00a0chose freedom over tyranny, Burchard\u2014at times poetic yet always fierce\u2014motivates us to free\u00a0ourselves from fear and take back our lives once and for all.\n", "genres": ["Productivity", "Philosophy", "Leadership", "Inspirational", "Personal Development", "Business", "Self Help", "Spirituality", "Psychology", "Nonfiction"]}, "452356": {"bookid": "452356", "title": "The Cure", "author": "Sonia Levitin", "series": "", "ratings": "832", "reviews": "96", "rating": "3.80", "description": "\"You are a criminal, Gemm 16884--aggressive, hostile, nonconforming.

Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.  Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.\"\n", "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Epic Fantasy", "Adult", "High Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Dragons", "Novels", "Adventure"]}, "202146": {"bookid": "202146", "title": "Flyboys: A True Story of Courage", "author": "James D.

Flyboys, a story of war and horror but also of friendship and honor, tells the story of those men. Over the remote Pacific island of Chichi Jima, nine American flyers-Navy and Marine pilots sent to bomb Japanese communications towers there-were shot down. One of those nine was miraculously rescued by a U.S. Navy submarine. The others were captured by Japanese soldiers on Chichi Jima and held prisoner. Then they disappeared. When the war was over, the American government, along with the Japanese, covered up everything that had happened on Chichi Jima. The records of a top-secret military tribunal were sealed, the lives of the eight Flyboys were erased, and the parents, brothers, sisters, and sweethearts they left behind were left to wonder. Flyboys reveals for the first time ever the extraordinary story of those men. Bradley's quest for the truth took him from dusty attics in American small towns, to untapped government archives containing classified documents, to the heart of Japan, and finally to Chichi Jima itself. What he discovered was a mystery that dated back far before World War II-back 150 years, to America's westward expansion and Japan's first confrontation with the western world. Bradley brings into vivid focus these brave young men who went to war for their country, and through their lives he also tells the larger story of two nations in a hellish war.  With no easy moralizing, Bradley presents history in all its savage complexity, including the Japanese warrior mentality that fostered inhuman brutality and the U.S. military strategy that justified attacks on millions of civilians. And, after almost sixty years of mystery, Bradley finally reveals the fate of the eight American Flyboys, all of whom would ultimately face a moment and a decision that few of us can even imagine.

Drawing on his experience as one of the foremost statesmen of the modern era\u2014advising presidents, traveling the world, observing and shaping the central foreign policy events of recent decades\u2014Kissinger now reveals his analysis of the ultimate challenge for the twenty-first century: how to build a shared international order in a world of divergent historical perspectives, violent conflict, proliferating technology, and ideological extremism.There has never been a true \u201cworld order,\u201d Kissinger observes. For most of history, civilizations defined their own concepts of order. Each considered itself the center of the world and envisioned its distinct principles as universally relevant. China conceived of a global cultural hierarchy with the Emperor at its pinnacle. In Europe, Rome imagined itself surrounded by barbarians; when Rome fragmented, European peoples refined a concept of an equilibrium of sovereign states and sought to export it across the world. Islam, in its early centuries, considered itself the world\u2019s sole legitimate political unit, destined to expand indefinitely until the world was brought into harmony by religious principles. The United States was born of a conviction about the universal applicability of democracy\u2014a conviction that has guided its policies ever since.Now international affairs take place on a global basis, and these historical concepts of world order are meeting. Every region participates in questions of high policy in every other, often instantaneously. Yet there is no consensus among the major actors about the rules and limits guiding this process, or its ultimate destination. The result is mounting tension.Grounded in Kissinger\u2019s deep study of history and his experience as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, World Order guides readers through crucial episodes in recent world history. Kissinger offers a unique glimpse into the inner deliberations of the Nixon administration\u2019s negotiations with Hanoi over the end of the Vietnam War, as well as Ronald Reagan\u2019s tense debates with Soviet Premier Gorbachev in Reykjav\u00edk. He offers compelling insights into the future of U.S.\u2013China relations and the evolution of the European Union, and examines lessons of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Taking readers from his analysis of nuclear negotiations with Iran through the West\u2019s response to the Arab Spring and tensions with Russia over Ukraine, World Order anchors Kissinger\u2019s historical analysis in the decisive events of our time.Provocative and articulate, blending historical insight with geopolitical prognostication, World Order is a unique work that could come only from a lifelong policymaker and diplomat.\n", "genres": ["War", "The World", "World History", "Philosophy", "Military Fiction", "History", "Economics", "International Relations", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "Earth", "Political Science"]}, "28391654": {"bookid": "28391654", "title": "Dark Horde Rising", "author": "Iain Hope", "series": "", "ratings": "149", "reviews": "3", "rating": "4.30", "description": "A thousand years have passed since the Elder Kingdoms were lost.

What calamity befell them, none now know. Centuries on and the north is a land where fell beasts and evil creatures roam unchecked, save in one place, the Wildlands of Darylor. Here mankind has slowly begun to explore and settle where once the Elder ruled, and within those lands, built amidst the ruins of a lost Elder city, lies the College of Magic. Inside, mankind seeks to rediscover the lost magics of old, but in secret one man desires the power to rule all and will stop at nothing to achieve his dream. Meanwhile, in the city of Shandrilos, in the shadow of the College of Magic, a groups of friends come together. Jon 'Bear' Madraig, fighter and mage, and his best friend the roguish swordsman and knight, Darin of Kenarth come to meet old friends and relive past adventures. The master mage, Arkadi Talcost and the beautiful druid, Rebba Korran, seek only to relax and enjoy some time away from the demands of their work and the College. For these friends, this is merely a reunion. However, for Zara Halven, the notorious Whore of Ostia, and for the monk, Garon Vale, the visit to Shandrilos is more; for one it is a chance for redemption and for the other it is a test of faith. Yet for the last of the friends, the visit to Shandrilos is the most important of all. For the huntress, Nat Bero it is a chance for forgiveness... and for revenge. These friends will be caught up in events that will change their lives forever, for the secret behind the destruction of the Elder is about to come to light... \"The fate of all can be decided by the actions of one who the gods guide to the right place at the right time. Do not underestimate the power of even the lowest to affect the paths of the mighty...\" The words of the seeress, Ry'Ina White Eyes If you are a reader of epic fantasy this is what you are looking for. If you liked Terry Brook's Shanara novels, Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia books, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings then this is a book for you.

It has been acknowledged for centuries as the cornerstone of spiritual awakening in all traditions of Eastern thought. In the West, however, it is still a relatively unrecognized concept of living. The Western mind is always restless, never content with the moment. Its internal dialogue is always firing off thoughts filled with emotional content and pulling the individual out of the present and into the past or future. But individuals raised in Western culture are becoming increasingly more aware of their overall sense of mental exhaustion, their lack of discipline and their inability to focus on demand. They are willing to expend the energy necessary to experience inner peace and a quiet mind that is waiting to follow the direction of their will. They are realizing that the endless struggle to fulfill the insatiable appetite of instant gratification is fruitless and tiresome at best. They are ripe for a new path in life and eager for a new set of instructions. This is the purpose of The Practicing Mind. It comprehensively deals with helping the individual understand exactly what present moment awareness is, how we are raised in a manner contradictory to this, and how we change our mindset to make this a part of our daily living. This book is accessible to readers of all philosophical backgrounds. Regardless of your perspective, you will find the book's insights most compelling.You can find the wisdom of both The Practicing Mind and The Meditating Mind in the combination package: The Total Mindset.For your convenience, THE PRACTICING MIND is now in mp3 CD audiobook format.\n", "genres": ["Productivity", "Philosophy", "Personal Development", "Audiobook", "Business", "Self Help", "Spirituality", "Music", "Psychology", "Nonfiction"]}, "194755": {"bookid": "194755", "title": "Esio Trot", "author": "Roald Dahl", "series": "", "ratings": "38716", "reviews": "2203", "rating": "3.74", "description": "Mr. Hoppy is in love with Mrs. Silver, but her heart belongs to Alfie, her pet tortoise.

At a Celtic conference, Kimberley, Kevin, Jennifer, Dave, and Paul meet wizard Loren Silvercloak. Returning with him to the magical kingdom of Fionavar to attend a festival, they soon discover that they are being drawn into the conflict between the dark and the light as Unraveller Rakoth Maugrim breaks free of his mountain prison and threatens the continued existence of Fionavar. They join mages, elves, dwarves, and the forces of the High King of Brennin to do battle with Maugrim, where Kay's imaginative powers as a world-builder come to the fore. He stunningly weaves Arthurian legends into the fluid mix of Celtic, Nordic, and Teutonic, creating a grand fantasy that sweeps readers into a heroic struggle that the author makes all the more memorable because of the tributes he pays to past masters.  The trilogy is a grand homage to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but while the echoes of Tolkien's masterwork are very real, the books offer the wonderful taste of a new fantasy writer cutting his teeth at the foot of a master. Kay has a very real connection to Tolkien--as Christopher Tolkien's assistant, Kay was invaluable in helping to wrestle Tolkien's posthumous The Silmarillion into shape for publication. Kay is undoubtedly one of the Canadian masters of high fantasy, and The Fionavar Tapestry is one of his most enduring works. Readers, however, should also check out Kay's Tigana, A Song for Arbonne, The Lions of Al-Rassan, and The Sarantine Mosaic to truly experience a master at work. --Jeffrey Canton \n", "genres": ["Epic Fantasy", "Canada", "Adult", "Arthurian", "Cultural", "High Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Fiction", "Mythology", "Adventure"]}, "218357": {"bookid": "218357", "title": "The Space Between Us", "author": "Thrity Umrigar", "series": "(Between Us #1)", "ratings": "45128", "reviews": "4305", "rating": "4.01", "description": "Set in modern-day India, it is the story of two compelling and achingly real women: Sera Dubash, an upper-middle-class Parsi housewife whose opulent surroundings hide the shame and disappointment of her abusive marriage, and Bhima, a stoic illiterate hardened by a life of despair and loss, who has worked in the Dubash household for more than twenty", "genres": ["Adult Fiction", "Indian Literature", "India", "Historical", "Cultural", "Literary Fiction", "Asian Literature", "Book Club", "Asia", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Historical Fiction"]}, "36135227": {"bookid": "36135227", "title": "City At The Edge Of Time", "author": "Janet E.

Somewhere ahead of him rests the only chance to beat back the minions of evil that are systematically killing and enslaving the last remnants of humanity.

What is prayer? How does it work? And more importantly, does it work? In theory, prayer is the essential human act, a priceless point of contact between us and the God of the universe. In practice, prayer is often frustrating, confusing, and fraught with mystery. Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference? is an exploration of the mysterious intersection where God and humans meet and relate. Writing as a fellow pilgrim, Yancey explores such questions as:Is God listening?Why should God care about me?If God knows everything, what\u2019s the point of prayer?Why do answers to prayer seem so inconsistent and capricious?Why does God seem sometimes close and sometimes far away?How can I make prayer more satisfying?\"I have found that the most important purpose of prayer may be to let ourselves be loved by God,\" says Yancey.

In her second powerHouse monograph, The Other Half of the Sky, Almog examines these women at a time when the demands of rapid growth and a sweeping desire for modernity is encroaching upon the traditions and values that have sustained their cultures as intact microcosms in the larger picture of China for centuries. Almog focuses on minority women, with an emphasis on the extraordinary situation of Muslim women in China, as well as the Mosuo women, a unique ethnic minority living within the boundaries of western China and one of the last matriarchal societies existing in the world.  The images in The Other Half of the Sky reflect how the communist revolution, with its vision of the nobility of physical labor and emphasis on gender equality, left its mark on women's and personal identity in a changing China. The book tells the story of the women of today\u2019s China, of their individualism in their domestic and work environments, and of minority women that have only recently been exposed to modernity. Given the nature of today's Chinese society and the conflict between the private self and society, The Other Half of the Sky presents a portrait of the public female representation as a challenge to express the dignity and heroism of the private, intimate female self.\n", "genres": []}, "12343998": {"bookid": "12343998", "title": "Mighty Be Our Powers: How Sisterhood, Prayer, and Sex Changed a Nation at War", "author": "Leymah Gbowee", "series": "", "ratings": "3711", "reviews": "456", "rating": "4.16", "description": "In a time of death and terror, Leymah Gbowee brought Liberia's women together--and together they led a nation to peace.

After her unemployment benefit amount is determined she has no choice but to pack up her apartment and move in with her mother and her mother\u2019s new husband. As her medications dwindle away she begins to head down a dark path of depression and mania that leads to self-medication with drugs and alcohol. The description of the symptoms of mental illness is rendered with alarming accuracy as she hits bottom with a life changing DUI. After her arrest her depression carries her into an inhumane place of despair and hopelessness. After a thwarted attempt at suicide we follow her tragic and comedic struggles to find health insurance with her pre-existing bipolar disorder meeting a motley crew of her friends and supporters along the way. Her \"journey\" starts with the vivid and wild friends she has when she is not mentally well. As she begins to repair her mind we meet her therapist, counselors and friends in recovery. Jill's mother plays an important roll by keeping things light with her humor and naivety. Her father\u2019s gruff, uneducated deportment leads to some laughs as well, with his strong spirit and fumbling dedication to his daughter. Fortunately the COBRA subsidy is granted to those who have lost their jobs in this nightmare economy. Jill is back in business, seeing her doctors and resuming her medications. Therapy and counseling are helping her see there is a way out of her challenging circumstances if she can just hold on and trust the help that is being provided to her by friends and professionals. Court appointed trips to AA and group therapy are another outlet for humor and parody. Things are starting to take form for Jill as her head begins to clear and she starts to understand the sobering reality of her multiple court dates and related obligations.On the road back to mental health an old boyfriend resurfaces with issues of his own. Russ is also an alcoholic who has been diagnosed as bipolar. Jill feels she can help him with his struggles as she has just emerged from the worst four months of her life. Jill and Russ attended film school together and he never could get her out of his mind after they separated. He made a film about her and it is this film that brings the two together. This bizarre coupling of two psychologically challenged individuals leads to an endearing romance built on creativity and an understanding that surpasses the conventional boundaries of romantic love. We join them through their whirlwind courtship and last minute wedding that is both comic and touching. All Jill ever wanted was a life to call her own and the couples' love brings them to a place of super absorbent paper towels and environmentally friendly cleaning products.Breaking through the challenges of finding health insurance and subsequent recovery from alcoholism, The Molecules That Surround Us chronicles a journey resulting in love, sanity and a \u201creal life.\u201d\n", "genres": ["Mental Illness", "Mental Health"]}, "18140608": {"bookid": "18140608", "title": "Conundrum", "author": "_Anonym", "series": "(Nine Inch Bride #1)", "ratings": "24", "reviews": "9", "rating": "3.25", "description": "Out of printSet in the near future, a young Wall Street analyst falls into joblessness and financial ruin in a major market crash.

Secret societies, banking cartels, and terrorist regimes have been funding and grooming political candidates for the highest offices of American government. A one man sleeper cell has been in play since 2008. The American people blindly voted him into position. Or did they? In a day when it is becoming a crime to worship Jesus Christ, signs of the times and biblical prophecies are unfolding at ever increasing rates. The story starts way back in a time veiled from your mind, when you fought a war you don't remember, a war for your very right to be born. Events playing out on Earth are extensions of that war. The original foes know you better than you know yourself, and they cannot be killed. They were never alive. The story is a fictional dramatization framed around principles of eternal truth. Earth Sink will penetrate your soul to the core. You will not be able to remain neutral or indifferent after reading this book in its entirety. The open minded reader will find answers to some of man\u2019s most profound questions and will likely come away with even more questions and some intensely emotional opinions. Earth Sink contains personal dreams experienced by the author and is based in part on the author's dreams. It is written mostly in narrative form with very little dialog. The eternal future of every individual on earth, alive or dead, hangs in the balance. A simple vicarious work can tip the scales toward eternal life. The sheer volume of vicarious work to be done is astronomical. Scant few ever attempt it. Will they endure long enough to complete the work, or will they succumb to the swelling tides of evil? While offering insights into theological anthropology and eschatology, Earth Sink depicts the tragic results of prevailing modern societal trends. The book exposes the primordial roots of political influences operating works of darkness that drive a progressive global state of affairs that exclusively favors the world's elites at the expense of liberty and individual freedoms. Earth Sink warns about the deliberate dismantling of the United States constitution from the inside by a compromised and corrupted executive branch of American government collaborating with secret combinations of banking cartels, mega corporations, and terrorist organizations. The most powerful position in the world is handed over to diabolical figures bent on seating a world government that opposes every virtue that once set mankind above beasts. The catastrophic consequences of globalized mainstream sociopolitical movements leading up to the second coming of Jesus Christ are unrelentingly drilled home in overwhelmingly graphic detail unleashed from the vivid and explosive imagination of the author. Earth Sink does not skimp on cataclysmic mayhem and apocalyptic doom. Take heed if you want to live. End times have already been underway longer than you realize. Earth Sink is a scathing and brutal portent. The author is absolutely unmindful of reader sensitivity. He employs no semblance of political correctness. Some readers may find parts of the story extremely disturbing, offensive, and controversial. Though written as fiction, the story alludes to the serious truth of what is going on around us and among us right now. In addition to whetting the inquisitive mind with a glimpse of cutting edge science and futuristic technologies, Earth Sink is both politically relevant and spiritually applicable to everyone. It describes a globalized society driven by influences that promote and then exploit worldwide pacifism, greed, envy, pride, and chaos which in turn drives a desperate need for change. Upon that desperate need for change, the world's elites slide into coveted positions of absolute power and total control while their bovine, unthinking constituents and porcine subjects wallow in passive complacency, recklessly relying on the mercies of those they have allowed to gain power over them. All will be well, or will it? Earth Sink extrapolates a possible future from past and present issues. Read the story as if it were real. Some of it is unequivocally real. Some of it may become real. Ponder it carefully and decide for yourself what is real and what is fiction. Beware, your time will soon run out. Earth Sink was written to do more than merely entertain. It was written as a wake up call to change lives, hopefully for the better.\n", "genres": []}, "16060509": {"bookid": "16060509", "title": "The Gokwe Kid - Dick of the Bushveld  (Last of the Rhodesians Chronicles of an African anarchist)", "author": "Karl Greenberg", "series": "", "ratings": "3", "reviews": "2", "rating": "4.67", "description": "War torn Rhodesia 1976.

Humans live on Earth and the Moon, last strongholds of their past power. Mars and the Net are inhabited by artificial intelligences and souls, these last obtained by digitizing the brain after death. The virtual reality allows the two races to communicate. Their differences are deep, their interests incompatible.With digitization, humans have postponed real death to an indeterminate future, but they are not happy. Towards the virtual beings they feel admiration but also envy and inferiority. The digital creatures instead cannot bear being relegated in worlds too small for their unbounded ambitions. Their Martian experience has allowed them to develop the competence necessary in extra-terrestrial environments, most of all to acquire the self-confidence indispensable for the colonization of other star systems. The Alpha Centauri project obtains the humans\u2019 support, in exchange for the waiver of any expansion on the Earth.

Miserable at his day job, he decided to take a leap of faith. His path to success was all or nothing, victory or death.He quit his job and dropped out of the white-collar world with all its trappings and amenities. Unemployed, he had to give up his residence. With a sleeping bag and a sackful of clothes he headed to Northwest London's Gladstone Park, settling in among the homeless, transients, dog walkers and the occasional irritated park worker. His only solace, an A4 notepad and a pen.Like the author, the main character Colossus Sosloss also quits his job, becomes homeless and sleeps in the park. Colossus observes the other homeless who reside at the park. Many of them with treatable or controllable mental illness but, in the post-Margaret Thatcher England, such individuals are human refuse. Dumped into society to fend for themselves and spiral downward amongst the neatly-trimmed hedges and glistening, manicured lawn of the sprawling public space.The character's travails are reminiscent of a Lewis Carroll-type adventure with subtle Dickensian undertones. Which include a lost parrot and an unfortunate man named Squirrel. We follow Colossus on his journey to the edge of sanity, with humorous interjections and clever idioms. A hero's quest, that inevitably ends with subterfuge, realization and reflection.Today, no longer homeless, Craig Stone is probably one of the most promising young writers to grace the indie and self-publishing world. Though at 31, Stone is a surprisingly mature author who seems to transcend the generations. His literary work is suitable for the very young and for those who have lived an interesting lifeThe Squirrel That Dreamt Of Madness is an imaginative tale that can only come from a brilliant, albeit delightfully demented, mind. Stone mixes humour with the cold, stark reality of life. Everything and everyone, is a metaphor for something either sinister or truthful. Gifted students may soon find this book on their required reading list for their advanced High School contemporary literature class.The author does not have a long laundry list of writers who inspired him, though he definitely channels some Steinbeckian qualities (the novel was written during the height of the Great Recession) and J.D. Salinger's, The Catcher in the Rye.Like Hemingway who retreated to the wild and lawless pre-Castro Cuba to pen his magnum opus The Old Man and the Sea, Stone chose to immerse himself in a colder and wetter climate to experience what his character had to endure. The old adage, you write what you know, still rings resonantly true. Stone certainly writes what he knows, and writes it exceptionally well.\" -enovelreviewsREVIEWS\"Genius.

You wake up filled with regrets, and haunted by dashed dreams, wondering what went wrong. For Paul Lipton, a successful lawyer in his sixties, his mind's howling in the darkness reminded him that time was slipping away. Perhaps partly because both his parents had died when they were young, and because he had already experienced his own serious health crisis, he wanted to be sure to live each day to the fullest. He decided he would start viewing each day afresh and in the now as a do-over, each night dying and each morning being reborn. His philosophy was to say, \"I am me today,\" and ask, \"How do I choose to live in the now?\" His solution to these sleepless nights became an adventure, and an experiment in ageless living.

With everything happening on Helen Peppe\u2019s backwoods Maine farm, life was wild--and not just for the animals.

While her feisty resilience and candor will inevitably remind readers of Jeannette Walls or Mary Karr, Peppe's wry insight and moments of tenderness with family and animals are entirely her own.

In a remarkable meditation on a subject at the troubled center of American life, Albert Memmi investigates racism as social pathology -- a cultural disease that prevails because it allows one segment of society to empower itself at the expense of another. By turns historical, sociological, and autobiographical, Racism moves beyond individual prejudice and taste to engage the broader questions of collective behavior and social responsibility.The book comprises three sections -- \"Description, \" \"Definition, \" and \"Treatment\" -- in which Memmi delineates racism's causes and hidden workings, examines its close affinity to colonialism, and considers its everyday manifestations over a period of centuries throughout the West. His topics include bigotry against Blacks, anti-Semitism, the meaning of \"whiteness, \" and the status of the Quebecois.For Memmi, the structure of racism has four \"moments\": the insistenc on difference; the negative valuation imposed on those who differ; the generalizing of this negative valuation to an entire group; and the use of generalization to legitimize hostility. Memmi shows how it is not racism's content -- which can change at will -- but its form that gives it such power and tenacity.\n", "genres": ["Philosophy", "Race", "Sociology", "Politics", "Nonfiction"]}, "18319051": {"bookid": "18319051", "title": "As Snow Falls", "author": "Elle Klass", "series": "", "ratings": "56", "reviews": "29", "rating": "4.02", "description": "It is the 20th century in California and the main character, a woman, has lived her life to the fullest.

Clark looks at life and death at the level of individual cells to address questions such as why we age, why cells die, and why sex and death seem to go hand in hand. Why must we die? To shed light on this question, Clark reaches far back in evolutionary history, to the moment when \"inevitable death\" (death from aging) first appeared. For cells during the first billion years, death, when it occurred, was accidental; there was nothing programmed into them that said they must die. But fierce competition gradually led to multicellular animals - size being an advantage against predators - and with this change came cell specialization and, most important, germ cells in which reproductive DNA was segregated from the DNA used to operate individual cells. When sexual reproduction evolved, it became the dominant form of reproduction on the planet, in part because mixing DNA from two individuals generates altogether new germline DNA. During this process, most mutations that have crept into the germline are corrected. But this does not happen in the other (somatic) cells of the body; the mutations are not corrected, and continue to accumulate. The somatic cells become, from a genetic point of view, both superfluous and dangerous. Nature's solution to this dilemma, Clark concludes, was programmed death - the somatic cells must die. Unfortunately, we are the somatic cells. Death is necessary to exploit to the fullest the advantages of sexual reproduction.\n", "genres": ["Evolution", "Death", "Biology", "Science", "Nonfiction"]}, "22065143": {"bookid": "22065143", "title": "The Vision of the Evening and the Morning", "author": "John Magallan Lopez", "series": "", "ratings": "0", "reviews": "1", "rating": "0.00", "description": "This book is about the corrilation which exists between the stars, the scriptures, and the traditions of the people of this continent of A", "genres": []}, "10097680": {"bookid": "10097680", "title": "Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem", "author": "Suzy Kassem", "series": "", "ratings": "179", "reviews": "36", "rating": "4.16", "description": "\"Suzy Kassem is an American writer, poet, philosopher, and artist of Egyptian origin.

Centering her story around the fictional family of Ling Tan, Buck recreates the heart wrenching devastation that war inflicted on these gentle innocent people. Ling Tan and his family were simple farmers living in peaceful isolation. Western technology, and likewise the machinery of war, were unknown in these outlying regions of China. And even though literacy was on the rise among the younger generations, the alarming reports of foreign aggression went largely ignored. For the peasants, the transition from one political ruler to another was virtually inconsequential; life revolved around their farms and their villages. Patriotism was not the concept of loving and defending a country; their land was their country. But as the invasion moves inland and the roads are jammed with survivors fleeing west, Ling Tan and his neighbors are forced to face the harsh realities of war. \"Days passed and with the rulers gone the people held themselves the more steadfast knowing that they and they alone were left to stand against the enemy and upon each man himself now depended what would happen. So it had happened again and again in other times, for rulers anywhere are always the first to fly, and the people must stay behind to be steadfast.\n", "genres": ["War", "China", "Fiction", "Historical", "Classics", "Cultural", "Literature", "Asian Literature", "World War II", "Asia", "Historical Fiction"]}, "23206389": {"bookid": "23206389", "title": "In the Beginning", "author": "Jacquelyn Verze-Reeher", "series": "(The Velvet Book #1)", "ratings": "5", "reviews": "2", "rating": "4.00", "description": "THE VELVET BOOK, YA/NEW AGE Fantasy.

George Bernard Shaw declared that he was the most beautiful human being he had ever seen and Aldous Huxley was one of his close friends. Whether debating politics with Nehru, discussing theories with Rupert Sheldrake and Iris Murdoch, or challenging his students not to take his words at face value, Krishnamurti engaged fully with every aspect of life. He is regarded by many modern religious figures as a great teacher, an extraordinary individual with revolutionary insights; Joseph Campbell, Alan Watts, Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra are all indebted to his writings.Freedom from the Known is one of Krishnamurti's most accessible works. Here, he reveals how we can free ourselves radically and immediately from the tyranny of the expected. By changing ourselves, we can alter the structure of society and our relationships. The vital need for change and the recognition of its very possibility form an essential part of this important book's message.\n", "genres": ["India", "Philosophy", "Cultural", "Buddhism", "Personal Development", "Religion", "Self Help", "Spirituality", "Eastern Philosophy", "Psychology", "Nonfiction"]}, "23013339": {"bookid": "23013339", "title": "The Land Uncharted", "author": "Keely Brooke Keith", "series": "(Uncharted #1)", "ratings": "381", "reviews": "82", "rating": "4.05", "description": "Lydia Colburn is a young physician dedicated to serving her village in the Land, an undetectable island in the South Atlantic Ocean.

Growing up under the tender care of Mattie, Lisbeth adopts her surrogate mother\u2019s deep-seated faith in God, her love of music and black-eyed peas, and the tradition of hunting for yellow crocuses in the early days of spring. In time, Lisbeth realizes she has freedoms and opportunities that Mattie does not have, though she\u2019s confined by the societal expectations placed on women born to privilege. As Lisbeth grows up, she struggles to reconcile her love for her caregiver with her parents\u2019 expectations, a task made all the more difficult as she becomes increasingly aware of the ugly realities of the American slavery system. When Lisbeth bears witness to a shockingly brutal act, the final vestiges of her naivet\u00e9 crumble around her. Lisbeth realizes she must make a choice, one that will require every ounce of the courage she learned from her beloved Mattie.

They're forced to walk out of the Everglades (they've got a knife, a small amount of Gatorade and some suspicious Spam). Sarah will have to count on her instincts\u2014and a guy she barely knows\u2014if they have any hope of making it back alive. Lost in the River of Grass takes on the classic survival genre using one of the country's most unique wild places as a backdrop. It is in the tradition of survival stories like Hatchet or My Side of the Mountain, where the young protagonist finds herself as she struggles to survive in an unforgiving wilderness. In this tense, character-driven thriller, Sarah must overcome prejudice and the unforgiving wilderness in a struggle to survive.\n", "genres": ["Teen", "Action", "Survival", "Young Adult", "Middle Grade", "Childrens", "Relationships", "Realistic Fiction", "Fiction", "Contemporary", "Adventure"]}, "19146017": {"bookid": "19146017", "title": "Hocus Pocus", "author": "Teresa Roblin", "series": "(Santorelli #1)", "ratings": "88", "reviews": "9", "rating": "3.32", "description": "Trying to outwit the spell only makes matters worse.

It's intended for therapists, professionals, caregivers and sufferers, and aims to connect the community by identifying common experience.

What does she look like?\" As the only African American soloist dancing with the prestigious American Ballet Theatre, Misty Copeland has made history. But when she first placed her hands on the barre at an after-school community center, no one expected the undersized, anxious thirteen-year-old to become a ground-breaking ballerina. When she discovered ballet, Misty was living in a shabby motel room, struggling with her five siblings for a place to sleep on the floor. A true prodigy, she was dancing en pointe within three months of taking her first dance class and performing professionally in just over a year: a feat unheard of for any classical dancer. But when Misty became caught between the control and comfort she found in the world of ballet and the harsh realities of her own life (culminating in a highly publicized custody battle), she had to choose to embrace both her identity and her dreams, and find the courage to be one of a kind. With an insider's unique point of view, Misty opens a window into the life of a professional ballerina who lives life center stage: from behind the scenes at her first auditions to her triumphant roles in some of the most iconic ballets. But in this beautifully written memoir, she also delves deeper to reveal the desire and drive that made her dreams reality.

Whether as a young journalist investigating city corruption, a campaign consultant guiding underdog candidates against entrenched orthodoxy, or as senior adviser to the president during one of the worst crises in American history, Axelrod held fast to his faith in the power of stories to unite diverse communities and ignite transformative political change. Now this legendary strategist, the mastermind behind Barack Obama\u2019s historic election campaigns, shares a wealth of stories from his forty-year journey through the inner workings of American democracy. Believer is the tale of a political life well lived, of a man who never gave up on the deepest promises our country has to offer.Believer reveals the roots of Axelrod\u2019s devotion to politics and his faith in democratic change. As a child of the \u201960s in New York City, Axelrod worked his first campaigns during a tumultuous decade that began with soaring optimism and ended in violence and chaos. As a young newspaperman in Chicago during the 1970s and \u201980s, Axelrod witnessed another world transformed when he reported on the dissolution of the last of the big city political machines\u2014Richard Daley, Dan Rostenkowski, and Harold Washington\u2014along with the emergence of a dynamic black independent movement that ultimately made Obama\u2019s ascent possible.After cutting his teeth in the rollicking world of Chicago journalism, Axelrod switched careers to become a political strategist. His unorthodox tactics during his first campaign helped him get Paul Simon unexpectedly elected to the Senate, and soon Axelrod\u2019s counsel was sought by the greatest lights of the Democratic Party. Working for path breakers like Hillary Clinton, Deval Patrick, and Rahm Emanuel\u2014and morally conflicted characters like Rod Blagojevich and John Edwards\u2014Axelrod, for better and worse, redefined the techniques by which modern political campaigns are run.The heart of Believer is Axelrod\u2019s twenty-year friendship with Barack Obama, a warm partnership that inspired both men even as it propelled each to great heights. Taking a chance on an unlikely candidate for the U.S. Senate, Axelrod ultimately collaborated closely with Obama on his political campaigns, and served as the invaluable strategist who contributed to the tremendous victories of 2008 and 2012. Switching careers again, Axelrod served as senior adviser to the president during one of the most challenging periods in national history: working at Obama\u2019s side as he battled an economic disaster; navigated America through two wars; and fought to reform health care, the financial sector, and our gridlocked political institutions. In Believer, Axelrod offers a deeper and richer profile of this extraordinary figure\u2014who in just four years vaulted from the Illinois State Senate to the Oval Office\u2014from the perspective of one who was at his side every step of the way.Spanning forty years that include corruption and transformation, turmoil and progress, Believer takes readers behind the closed doors of politics even as it offers a thrilling call to democratic action. Axelrod\u2019s Believer is a powerful and inspiring memoir enlivened by the charm and candor of one of the greatest political strategists in recent American history.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, author of\u00a0The Bully Pulpit\u00a0and\u00a0Team of Rivals\n\u201cBeautifully written with warmth, humor, and remarkable self-awareness,\u00a0Believer\u00a0is one of the finest political memoirs I have ever read.\u201d\n", "genres": ["Memoir", "Biography", "History", "Audiobook", "Biography Memoir", "Autobiography", "North American Hi...", "Politics", "American History", "Nonfiction", "Political Science"]}, "29897456": {"bookid": "29897456", "title": "Luke Walker: Animal Stick Up For-Er", "author": "Violet's Vegan Comics", "series": "", "ratings": "21", "reviews": "6", "rating": "4.71", "description": "Luke Walker is an eight year old boy with a mind of his own.

Others are sure it's the environment we experience in childhood. But could it be that many of our individual characteristics\u2014our health, our intelligence, our temperaments\u2014are influenced by the conditions we encountered before birth? That's the claim of an exciting and provocative field known as fetal origins. Over the past twenty years, scientists have been developing a radically new understanding of our very earliest experiences and how they exert lasting effects on us from infancy well into adulthood. Their research offers a bold new view of pregnancy as a crucial staging ground for our health, ability, and well-being throughout life.Author and journalist Annie Murphy Paul ventures into the laboratories of fetal researchers, interviews experts from around the world, and delves into the rich history of ideas about how we're shaped before birth. She discovers dramatic stories: how individuals gestated during the Nazi siege of Holland in World War II are still feeling its consequences decades later; how pregnant women who experienced the 9/11 attacks passed their trauma on to their offspring in the womb; how a lab accident led to the discovery of a common household chemical that can harm the developing fetus; how the study of a century-old flu pandemic reveals the high personal and societal costs of poor prenatal experience. Origins also brings to light astonishing scientific findings: how a single exposure to an environmental toxin may produce damage that is passed on to multiple generations; how conditions as varied as diabetes, heart disease, and mental illness may get their start in utero; why the womb is medicine's latest target for the promotion of lifelong health, from preventing cancer to reducing obesity. The fetus is not an inert being, but an active and dynamic creature, responding and adapting as it readies itself for life in the particular world it will enter. The pregnant woman is not merely a source of potential harm to her fetus, as she is so often reminded, but a source of influence on her future child that is far more powerful and positive than we ever knew. And pregnancy is not a nine-month wait for the big event of birth, but a momentous period unto itself, a cradle of individual strength and wellness and a crucible of public health and social equality.With the intimacy of a personal memoir and the sweep of a scientific revolution, Origins presents a stunning new vision of our beginnings that will change the way you think about yourself, your children, and human nature itself.\n", "genres": ["Medical", "Biology", "Medicine", "Audiobook", "Childrens", "Science", "Parenting", "Health", "Psychology", "Nonfiction"]}, "1712177": {"bookid": "1712177", "title": "Siege At Jadotville", "author": "Declan Power", "series": "", "ratings": "302", "reviews": "41", "rating": "4.03", "description": "The Irish soldier has never been a stranger to fighting the enemy with the odds stacked against him.

He listens as they howl, deriding him with predictions of calamities to come. Tears well up in his eyes as one specter, standing dominant over the others, casts its judgment on his soul. Scarlet Crosses, Pg. 266  Deep within the shadows, secrets, veils, and masks of a spellbinding mystery, beckons a story of unconditional love and acceptance; of reconciliation and shifting dogmas. Scarlet Crosses, the gripping debut novel by J. Beckham Steele, reveals that sometimes the search for answers yields unexpected truths.  Judgement and justice turn the heart of New Orleans police detective Albert Harris inside out in Scarlet Crosses, a timely story of family, hidden identities, rejection, bullying\u2014and poetic justice. Layered within the Crescent City's all-night bars, iconic cathedrals, cemeteries, and pastoral lands rising from the Mississippi valley are riveting mysteries of identity and consequences of actions\u2014both innocent and criminal\u2014ripped from today's headlines. For Harris, \"just another case\" in a long career of investigations will become a transformative journey, heartbreaking and inspiring, proving that sometimes the truth lies within.  Harris is a seasoned detective and a man of principle. Every dogma he has held clashes against the masks all around him on the streets of New Orleans. To him, there's no room in Heaven for the L, the G, the B, and the T. His Christian ideals have crashed against his own walls and separated him from his grandson Kyle, whose feminine behaviors Harris can no longer discipline away. Harris' probing has stopped, frozen in the fear of what he may discover.  Still mourning the senseless death of his daughter and angered by the travesty of justice that led to her killer's acquittal, Harris blames the system, he blames attorneys, but mostly-he blames himself. When the city's top criminal defense attorney, Megan Callahan-a woman Harris detests-becomes a victim herself, he is tasked with the investigation. The truth he seeks, and the truth that seeks him, is buried deep within her heart. With Megan trapped in a whirlpool of fear, compassion trumps bitterness as Harris becomes a lifeline of hope.  The lines between personal and professional lives blur for Harris and Megan as they navigate uncharted waters of the flip side of The Big Easy. Harris will become tangled in the cloaked, hide-and-seek lives of some in the LGBT community. The investigation becomes a harrowing journey for all. Demons long thought vanquished will reappear, and hidden fears will be uncovered. Megan ultimately holds the key to untangle the twisted lines of the investigation and to the biggest case of Harris' life-his own conflicted heart. \n", "genres": []}, "32470947": {"bookid": "32470947", "title": "How To Suck Cock Deep", "author": "Jock Camp", "series": "", "ratings": "5", "reviews": "2", "rating": "4.60", "description": "Do you want to suck cock deep?

Like Granfield\u2019s other titles on Canadian military history, The Vimy Oaks uses the experiences of a single soldier to provide the framework for sharing the details of Vimy Ridge and the First World War. In April 1917, Signal Corps member Leslie Miller picked up a few acorns from the muddy battlefields at Vimy and mailed them to his family back home in Ontario. Granfield describes how the oak trees resulting from these acorns became the centre of a project to mark the one-hundredth anniversary of the end of the First World War, encouraging readers to reflect not only on the significance of Vimy Ridge, but also the journey to renewal and peace.Beautifully illustrated with a combination of archival photographs and Brian Deines\u2019 softly expressive paintings, The Vimy Oaks is a compelling addition to Canadian historical nonfiction for younger readers. Granfield\u2019s meticulously-researched text is clear, but never simplistic, and she deftly manages to keep the book\u2019s focus on the theme of remembrance, rather than glorifying military conflict. With possibilities for use in classrooms and libraries long past the centennial of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, The Vimy Oaks is highly recommended to anyone who wants to learn more about Canada\u2019s role in the First World War and the ways Canada has chosen to commemorate its soldiers\u2019 sacrifices.Review by Roseanne Gauthier\n", "genres": ["War", "Picture Books", "Canada", "Historical", "Cultural", "History", "Childrens", "Nonfiction"]}, "34507930": {"bookid": "34507930", "title": "Everything I needed To Know I learned In Hell: Some Thoughts on Turning Darkness Into Light, or How To Escape The Mess You've Made", "author": "Dan  Balestrero", "series": "", "ratings": "10", "reviews": "6", "rating": "4.40", "description": "This book is about ideas that have helped myself and others escape our private hells and achieve unlimited Success.
