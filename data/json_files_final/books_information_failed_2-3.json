And when no one is powerful enough to transform him back except Ivy, it sparks the rumor: Like father, like daughter. Ivy has heard it all before - that her father, who left when she was seven - was involved with the darkest of magic.Making the rumors worse, someone uses an evil spell book to bring back two of history's most nefarious killers. Ivy's got a simple plan to set things right: find the real dark spell caster, steal the book, and reverse the spell. No problem! But she'll have to deal with something more dangerous than murderous spirits that want her and her friends dead: the school's resident bad boy and hotter-than-brimstone demon, Nick Marcelli. Nick's offering Ivy more than his help with recovering the missing book - he's offering her a way to ditch her scaly reputation as a lizard-lover. Demons are about as hard to handle as black magic, and as Ivy soon discovers, it's going to take more than a lot of luck and a little charm if she wants to survive long enough to clear her status as a dark witch, get a warm-blooded boyfriend, and have her former date back to eating meal worms before the week's end.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Fantasy", "Paranormal", "Magic", "Demons", "Young Adult", "Paranormal Romance", "Urban Fantasy", "Romance", "Witches"]}, "5344": {"bookid": "5344", "title": "Hard Times", "author": "Charles Dickens", "series": "", "ratings": "62118", "reviews": "3457", "rating": "3.53", "description": "\"My satire is against those who see figures and averages, and nothing else,\" proclaimed Charles Dickens in explaining the theme of this classic novel.

Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a \"fanatic of the demonstrable fact,\" who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime. Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.Considered Dickens' harshest indictment of mid-19th-century industrial practices and their dehumanizing effects, this novel offers a fascinating tapestry of Victorian life, filled with the richness of detail, brilliant characterization, and passionate social concern that typify the novelist's finest creations.Of Dickens' work, the eminent Victorian critic John Ruskin had this to say: \"He is entirely right in his main drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions.\"\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "British Literature", "Literature", "Historical Fiction", "Classic Literature", "Academic", "Victorian", "Classics", "European Literature", "Historical", "Novels", "19th Century", "School"]}}
