Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries\nHaving clear boundaries is essential to a healthy, balanced lifestyle. A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words, boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend offer biblically-based answers to these and other tough questions, showing us how to set healthy boundaries with our parents, spouses, children, friends, co-workers, and even ourselves.\n", "genres": ["Personal Development", "Counselling", "Self Help", "Christianity", "Psychology", "Faith", "Christian Living", "Christian", "Religion", "Nonfiction", "Relationships"]}, "28268515": {"bookid": "28268515", "title": "The Road Back to You: An Enneagram Journey to Self-Discovery", "author": "Ian Morgan Cron", "series": "", "ratings": "43563", "reviews": "3379", "rating": "4.21", "description": "Ignorance is bliss except in self-awareness...What you don't know about yourself can hurt you and your relationships\u2015and even keep you in the shallows with God.

Most all of us who participated in writing this book found ourselves surprised by other people's reactions to our loss.  The Widow or Widower Next Door is a collection of stories that reveal the unexpected reactions that occur. We prepare for school by attending Pre-K. We prepare to get our Driver's License by taking driving lessons. We got to pre-marital counseling before we wed. Nothing, but nothing prepares us for the loss of a spouse. We hope this book will get people thinking and preparing, and we hope that it will help them learn how to better help a friend or a neighbor with such a loss.  Readers have asked why is there a logo of a hand with a heart in it as the cover of the book? The answer lies in The Valentine's Story, excerpted from the book: \"The doctors told me that Pat was not going to be with me much longer. I took a red marker and a ballpoint pen with me to the hospital on Valentine's Day. I took his hand and drew a heart on his palm. I wrote \"my heart\" inside it and said 'I love you; you hold my heart in your hand'. The mortician left it in place. Pat still holds my heart in his hand and my heart is warm because of it.\n", "genres": []}, "23154550": {"bookid": "23154550", "title": "Sweet Mungo", "author": "Meriel Brooke", "series": "", "ratings": "34", "reviews": "29", "rating": "4.26", "description": "Sweet Mungo...'Mungo', An unusual name for an unusual boy.

Growing up in England, at a time when homosexuality was illegal and rarely discussed. Mungo's looks are so arresting that sometimes his beauty spells danger. Abused by his father; seduced by a teacher; sodomised by a gang of roughs... Not the best upbringing. But there is hope, close friends like Amy and Tom who are willing to be there for him. Hilary, who starts as an enemy and then becomes a friend and who is maybe destined to be something much more...Mungo loves music and singing in a choir. He eventually decides to join the theatre, becoming an accomplished actor. But his sexuality remains confused, even the prospect of marriage and parenthood offers him no solace. Will he find himself or is he destined to live a life of lies?The story of Mungo is perhaps the story of every young child who ever grew up with troubles and nightmares. Or perhaps it\u2019s the story of every young adolescent who ever questioned their sexuality. Or perhaps it\u2019s the story of every man and woman who has ever questioned whether they will find success, their place in the world, and most importantly of all... contentment.To read Sweet Mungo is to be transported to a world of both harshness and hope, a world of pain and pleasure, and most importantly, a world that allows you to get to know and to care for Sweet Mungo.\n", "genres": []}, "25712105": {"bookid": "25712105", "title": "The Creator of the Universe: A Scientific Approach to Christian Faith", "author": "Corrado Ghinamo", "series": "", "ratings": "2", "reviews": "0", "rating": "4.00", "description": "Are science and faith antithetic?

Are the new discoveries in science making faith in God totter? Or can science be the basis for strong faith and the belief in a Creator? Discover how. The Creator of the Universe is the author's original manuscript that gave birth to the book \"The Beautiful Scientist.\" This amazing book takes an interesting look at science and faith, and how the two can work together to prove there is a Creator. Corrado Ghinamo believes it is the very existence of the universe that allows people to see there is a super-entity, there is a God. He uses scientific evidence, like the Big Bang Theory, the smallest particles of the universe, the galaxies, and what he calls the Super-Force to prove just that: God does exist. Creation and evolution are not two separate ideals; rather evolution is one of the means that God used and still uses in creating and governing the universe. Ghinamo shows that God is a logical necessity to complete the vision of scientist's universe. The same goes for people of faith; there is scientific evidence that can further the existence of a Creator. The Creator of the Universe: A Scientific Approach to Christian Faith uses easy-to-understand language, examples from everyday life, and an easy-to-follow structure to prove that the universe, far more beautiful and complex than people can imagine, was in fact created by God, and that evidence and rationality in science can lead to the belief in God.\n", "genres": []}, "25537520": {"bookid": "25537520", "title": "My Dragonfly: And the Lessons He Taught Me", "author": "Kathy Zengolewicz", "series": "", "ratings": "4", "reviews": "0", "rating": "4.00", "description": "My Dragonfly represents the son that Kathy Lost to drug addiction in September of 2012.
