Browning\u2019s shocking account of how a unit of average middle-aged Germans became the cold-blooded murderers of tens of thousands of Jews\u2014now with a new afterword and additional photographs. Ordinary Men is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of \u00a0RPB 101 were not fanatical\u00a0Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. \u00a0Ordinary Men is a powerful, chilling, and important work, with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today. \u00a0\n", "genres": ["European History", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Politics", "World War II", "Holocaust", "Historical", "Cultural", "History", "Germany", "War"]}, "20170404": {"bookid": "20170404", "title": "Station Eleven", "author": "Emily St. John Mandel", "series": "", "ratings": "399393", "reviews": "46016", "rating": "4.06", "description": "Set in the days of civilization's collapse, Station Eleven tells the story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear.

Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool.

When he becomes fixated on a classmate named Jennifer Arkland and she goes missing, we are left with the looming question: Is Mike Engleby involved? As he grows up, finding a job and even a girlfriend in London, Mike only becomes more and more detached from those around him in an almost anti-coming-of-age.

Then one day, at the end of the summer, the \u201cghost train\u201d arrives, a silent, incredible funeral train loaded with the bodies of thousands of refugees, bringing the village its first taste of the horrors of the civil war. Train to Pakistan is the story of this isolated village that is plunged into the abyss of religious hate.

In attempting to answer this question, I came across the problem of types; for it is one's psychological type which from the outset determines and limits a person's judgment. My book, therefore, was an effort to deal with the relationship of the individual to the world, to people and things. It discussed the various aspects of consciousness, the various attitudes the conscious mind might take toward the world, and thus constitutes a psychology of consciousness regarded from what might be called a clinical angle.\"In expounding his system of personality types Jung relied not so much on formal case data as on the countless impressions and experiences derived from the treatment of nervous illnesses, from intercourse with people of all social levels, \"friend and foe alike,\" and from an analysis of his own psychological nature. The book is rich in material drawn from literature, aesthetics, religion, and philosophy. The extended chapters that give general descriptions of the types and definitions of Jung's principal psychological concepts are key documents in analytical psychology.\n", "genres": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "German Literature", "Self Help", "Philosophy", "European Literature", "Education", "Health", "Mental Health", "Psychoanalysis", "Classics"]}, "35445445": {"bookid": "35445445", "title": "Finding Your Colors: Fine Art Adult Coloring Book", "author": "Hertz Nazaire", "series": "", "ratings": "9", "reviews": "0", "rating": "4.78", "description": "Finding Your Colors is a series of fine art adult coloring books created by Haitian born artist Hertz Nazaire.

The day after the accident, while going through Cod\u2019s papers, lawyer Wynona Vasquez discovers that he had been secretly engaged to a Thai immigrant who is arriving by train that evening.\tElected by unanimous decision to be the welcoming committee, Weston arrives at the train station prepared for anything but the lovely forlorn creature he finds waiting in the rain. Though appearing waif-like, Song Phan-Rang is anything but fragile. Her mettle quickly rises to the surface in her determination to remain in Y-oh-ming.\tForced together by their circumstances, Weston and Song are explosive. Used to solitude, Weston is driven crazy by the obliging Song. But as Song shows her prowess not only as a housekeeper and cook, but as a rider and rancher as well, Weston discovers that against his best efforts (and damned if he'll ever admit it) -- he's falling in love.\tThe morning after the Christmas Cotillion, where cowboys by the dozen lined up for a dance with the exotic Song, and Weston wrangled the last one, she discovers her visa has expired. Pledging her Uncle Thieu's farm in Thailand as a dowry, Song asks Weston to marry her. Swearing that this is not a good idea at all -- he does.\tSong blossoms in America. Weston's sister Olive, a schoolteacher, helps Song with her English, and introduces her to the ideas of the Founding Fathers, most notably Tom Paine. Firebrand and activist Wynona employs Song in her office. Her first assignment is working with Shoshone shaman MAD BULL and Bull's young assistant, Jack Deerstalker as they fight a referendum that would allow gambling on their reservation.\tAs winter melts into spring, Song and Weston continue to profess their marriage is simply one of convenience, though it is obvious to everybody that the two are in love. Obvious to everyone that is, but Jack Deerstalker who has fallen for her himself.\tOne night as Weston returns earlier than expected from a rodeo, he finds Jack in his living room, alone with Song. Enraged, Weston explodes, throwing Jack out of the house. That night a fierce winter storm blows. The creek rises and floods, endangering thirty head of cattle caught on the other side. Song springs into action, riding side by side with Weston. When a baby calf slips into the icy creek, Song plunges in after it. Together, Weston and Song pull the animal free. Weston is knocked speechless by her bravery. Later, as he warms her by a roaring fire, Song and Weston make love for the first time.\tA few days later, Wynona and Song are introduced to the case of illegal immigrant Thai workers, forced to toil as slaves in the garment industry in El Segundo, California. Song becomes deeply involved with the workers and their plight \u2013 the search for a desperate promise of freedom. With her work, she discovers the power true freedom holds.\tBut her work and growing sense of the true power of freedom begins to tear at the budding love between Weston and Song. Meanwhile, the referendum Jack, Wynona, and Song fought so hard against has been defeated. There will be no gambling on the reservation. Jack organizes a rodeo to raise money for an investment deal for the reservation. Weston agrees to ride \u2013 on one condition. Jack gets the bull, Baby Face that killed Cody.The night before the rodeo, Weston finds a letter Song has written to the garment workers she is helping. \u201cWe are, every one of us, entitled to a life with dignity. To life with honor. There are those who would attempt to steal our dignity, to seize our honor. But it is only when we allow this deepest core of our being to be ripped from us that we become enslaved. Remember, you, too, have been touched by God.\u201dThe next morning, Weston leaves for the rodeo without her. At the rodeo, in an eerie replay of Cody\u2019s accident, the bull throws Weston. Song nurses Weston back to health, but still torn between freedom's power and her growing love, Song knows she must ultimately choose. Several weeks later, with Weston well on his way to mending, Song and Olive host a dinner party at Snowy Moon to celebrate Weston\u2019s recovery. Along with Zeb, Jack Deerstalker and Mad Bull are there to join in the festivities. But in the middle of the revelry, the phone rings: it\u2019s Jenny Chang and it\u2019s about the case of the immigrant workers.Song knows she must go.The next day, Weston drives her to the train station.Returning to the ranch, Weston, still suffering from his injuries, limps painfully to the corral, and saddles up his horse. He rides across the rolling plains to the waterfall where he and Song had spent so much time in happier times now long gone by. Watching the water tumble by like his lost hope, suddenly, Weston picks up a stone, and fires it into the tumultuous fall. He whistles for his horse, and throws himself into the saddle.Across the plains, the train continues to roll. Inside, an uproar arises among the passengers. Song forces her way to the window.

At eighteen, she met Tod Hostetter at a local dance, having no idea that the mercurial charmer she would impulsively wed was heir to one of the wealthiest families in America. But when he died twelve years later, Allene packed her bags for New York City. Never once did she look back.From the vantage point of the American upper class, Allene embodied the tumultuous Gilded Age. Over the course of four more marriages, she weathered personal tragedies during World War I and the catastrophic financial reversals of the crash of 1929. From the castles and ch\u00e2teaus of Europe, she witnessed the Russian Revolution and became a princess.

Writing with humour, humanity and solid scientific information reminiscent of Stumbling on Happiness and Freakonomics, Piers Steel explains why we knowingly and willingly put off a course of action despite recognizing we'll be worse off for it.For those who surf the Web instead of finishing overdue assignments, who always say diets start tomorrow, who stay up late watching TV to put off going to sleep, The Procrastination Equation explains why we do what we do \u2014 or in this case don't\u00a0\u2014 and why in Western societies we're in the midst of an escalating procrastination epidemic.Dr. Piers Steel takes on the myths and misunderstandings behind procrastination and motivation\u00a0\u2014 showing us how procrastination affects our lives, health, careers and happiness and what we can do about it. With accessible prose and the benefits of new scientific research, he provides insight into why we procrastinate even though the result is that we are less happy, healthy, even wealthy. Who procrastinates and why? How many ways, big and small, do we procrastinate? How can we stop doing it? The reasons are part cultural, part psychological, part biological. And, with a million new ways to distract ourselves in the digitized world\u00a0\u2014 all of which feed on our built-in impulsiveness\u00a0\u2014 more of us are potentially damaging ourselves by putting things off. But Steel not only analyzes the factors that weigh us down but the things that motivate us\u00a0\u2014 including understanding the value of procrastination.\n", "genres": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Self Help", "Personal Development", "Education", "Audiobook", "Productivity", "Unfinished", "Business"]}, "316661": {"bookid": "316661", "title": "Thieves' Paradise", "author": "Eric Jerome Dickey", "series": "", "ratings": "2596", "reviews": "58", "rating": "4.04", "description": "The sensational New York Times bestselling author of Between Lovers, Liar\u2019s Game, and Cheaters returns with an irresistible novel about grifters and con artists, brothers and sisters, looking for love and making ends meet\u2014on the wrong side of t", "genres": ["Adult Fiction", "Contemporary", "Cultural", "Romance", "Fiction", "Drama", "Thriller", "American", "African American Literature", "Urban", "Erotica", "African American"]}, "3873296": {"bookid": "3873296", "title": "The September Sisters", "author": "Jillian Cantor", "series": "", "ratings": "548", "reviews": "110", "rating": "3.68", "description": "Abigail Reed and her younger sister, Becky, are always at each other's throats.

To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of American loneliness and violence.

In this very personal and historical account in which Ruby writes about her truth of the war which she shares with no one but the diary. She describes the terror she experiences night after night, wondering if she will see the next day. What these citizen's managed is mind-boggling and is a reminder of how atrocious war really is. Ruby says: \"September 21, 1941 . . . We are hypnotized by propaganda; by the impact of particular places and persons; by religion, by war, and by ourselves, by our own terrible easy suggestibility. We are sheep, dumb fool sheep. Consider this huge derision of patriotism and of war. As I looked over Kent yesterday, so peaceful, all the harvest in, so green, so quiet, the sense of the folly of the war enveloped me ever more tightly and suffocating then in Blitzed London. Much of London is offensive to the sight, so that when one sees portions of it utterly destroyed unconsciously one is reconciled to the destruction. . . . The further I went from London the more I was convinced that war is only made by the few bad men in power, for their own profit. War pays the armament makers. The puzzle is: Why do common men obey the warlords? Why? Because they are hypnotized by words, deluded by propaganda and patriotism. Oh God! What fools men are! . . . One thing I determined, and that is, to guard my own mind. That seems the most important thing to me today, to protect my mind and to keep out the crazy propaganda and all the world\u2019s false beliefs. The everlasting verities, those are what I want to discern and the realities, and mainly the beautiful and good realities. War is a reality and Hitler is a reality, but neither Hitler nor war is enduring; both will pass away, but the grass will remain, beauty will remain. Ruby says \"This world is hell, and Hitler is Satan himself. The last war convinced me of the reality of the Devil: this war reinforces that conviction. I say, men create war; yes, but the evil in men\u2019s hearts, which creates this sort of war, is the devil\u2019s evil itself. .

As a deputy in the North Carolina town of New Bern, Miles Ryan not only grieves for Missy, but also longs to bring the unknown driver to justice. Then Miles meets Sarah Andrews. The second grade teacher of his son, Jonah, Sarah had left Baltimore after a difficult divorce to start over in the gentler surroundings of New Bern. Perhaps it's her own emotional wounds that make her sensitive to the hurt she first sees in Jonah's eyes, and then his father's. Tentatively, Sarah and Miles reach out to each other. Soon they are both laughing for the first time in years . . . and falling in love. Neither will be able to guess how closely linked they are to a shocking secret -- one that will force them to question everything they ever believed in . . . and make a heartbreaking choice that will change their lives forever.\n", "genres": ["Adult", "Chick Lit", "Adult Fiction", "Love", "Womens Fiction", "Fiction", "Romance", "Contemporary Romance", "Contemporary", "Mystery", "Drama"]}, "67931": {"bookid": "67931", "title": "The Analyst", "author": "John Katzenbach", "series": "(The Analyst #1)", "ratings": "46106", "reviews": "3493", "rating": "4.12", "description": "'Happy fifty-third birthday, Doctor.

Among their leaders was Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose essays, lectures, and poems defined the American transcendentalist movement, though he himself disliked the term.Emerson advocates a rejection of fear-driven conformity, a total independence of thought and spirit, and a life lived in harmony with nature. He believes that Truth lies within each individual, for each is part of a greater whole, a universal \u201cover-soul\u201d through which we transcend the merely mortal.Emerson was extremely prolific throughout his life; his collected writings fill forty volumes.

Entering into a bargain with him wouldn\u2019t be good either. Unfortunately, Taryn Warner, a latent wolf shifter, doesn\u2019t have many options open to her right now. Okay, she has no options. Basically it comes down to whether she\u2019ll do what it takes to escape the arranged mating with the sick SOB that her father set up. As the answer in this case is yes, it looks as though she\u2019ll have to agree to Trey Coleman\u2019s deal\u2026 she\u2019ll have to mate with him instead. Having always disliked shifter politics, Trey Coleman hadn\u2019t bothered trying to form alliances with other packs. Now that his uncle \u2013 a wolf with many alliances \u2013 means to take Trey\u2019s territory and his pack, he has no option but to form some alliances of his own very quickly or he\u2019ll be easily outnumbered in the upcoming battle. He figures that the easiest way to do that would be to mate with a female whose Alpha is powerful and influential. There\u2019s only one problem with that \u2013 he would then be stuck with her, and the last thing Trey wants is a mate. When he hears of Taryn\u2019s situation, he offers her a deal \u2013 if she falsely claims he\u2019s her true mate and allows him to claim her, he\u2019ll save her from her arranged mating and then let her leave after the battle with his uncle is over. Sounds like a pretty straightforward deal...but soon Taryn and Trey realize they got more than they bargained for. Their mating instincts to protect and possess are weighing on them, they crave each other\u2019s touch and company, and their inner wolves don\u2019t like it whenever they\u2019re apart.

Lila, homeless and alone after years of roaming the countryside, steps inside a small-town Iowa church - the only available shelter from the rain - and ignites a romance and a debate that will reshape her life. She becomes the wife of a minister, John Ames, and begins a new existence while trying to make sense of the life that preceded her newfound security. Neglected as a toddler, Lila was rescued by Doll, a canny young drifter, and brought up by her in a hardscrabble childhood. Together they crafted a life on the run, living hand to mouth with nothing but their sisterly bond and a ragged blade to protect them. Despite bouts of petty violence and moments of desperation, their shared life was laced with moments of joy and love. When Lila arrives in Gilead, she struggles to reconcile the life of her makeshift family and their days of hardship with the gentle Christian worldview of her husband which paradoxically judges those she loves. Revisiting the beloved characters and setting of Robinson's Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning Gilead and Home, a National Book Award finalist, Lila is a moving expression of the mysteries of existence that is destined to become an American classic.\n", "genres": ["Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Literature", "Literary Fiction", "Historical", "Novels", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Contemporary", "Historical Fiction", "Religion"]}, "39357430": {"bookid": "39357430", "title": "The Watchmaker's Doctor", "author": "G.M.T.

In Focus, he delves into the science of attention in all its varieties, presenting a long overdue discussion of this little-noticed and under-rated mental asset that matters enormously for how we navigate life. Attention works much like a muscle: use it poorly and it can wither; work it well and it grows. In an era of unstoppable distractions, Goleman persuasively argues that now more than ever we must learn to sharpen focus if we are to contend with, let alone thrive, in a complex world.Goleman boils down attention research into a threesome: inner, other, and outer focus. A well-lived life demands we be nimble at each. Goleman shows why high-achievers need all three kinds of focus, as demonstrated by rich case studies from fields as diverse as competitive sports, education, the arts, and business. Those who excel rely on what he calls Smart Practices such as mindfulness meditation, focused preparation and recovery, positive emotions and connections, and mental \"prosthetics\" that help them improve habits, add new skills, and sustain excellence. Combining cutting-edge research with practical findings, Focus reveals what distinguishes experts from amateurs and stars from average performers. Ultimately, Focus calls upon readers not only to pay attention to what matters most to them personally, but also to turn their attention to the pressing problems of the wider world, to the powerless and the poor, and to the future, not just to the seductively simple demands of here-and-now.\n", "genres": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Self Help", "Personal Development", "Leadership", "Education", "Audiobook", "Productivity", "Business"]}, "54422141": {"bookid": "54422141", "title": "The Art Dealer's Wife", "author": "Joe Hilley", "series": "", "ratings": "33", "reviews": "12", "rating": "4.45", "description": "Jack Frazer is an award-winning New York journalist, but he's in a slump.

Based on fifteen years of research into energy medicine, Dr. Myss's work shows how every illness corresponds to a pattern of emotional and psychological stresses, beliefs, and attitudes that have influenced corresponding areas of the human body. Anatomy of the Spirit also presents Dr. Myss's breakthrough model of the body's seven centers of spiritual and physical power, in which she synthesizes the ancient wisdom of three spiritual traditions-the Hindu chakras, the Christian sacraments, and the Kabbalah's Tree of Life-to demonstrate the seven stages through which everyone must pass in the search for higher consciousness and spiritual maturity. With this model, Dr. Myss shows how you can develop your own latent powers of intuition as you simultaneously cultivate your personal power and spiritual growth.By teaching you to see your body and spirit in a new way, Anatomy of the Spirit provides you with the tools for spiritual maturity and physical wholeness that will change your life.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "New Age", "Self Help", "Philosophy", "Personal Development", "Spirituality", "Health", "Metaphysics", "Inspirational"]}, "696703": {"bookid": "696703", "title": "Not Even a Hint: Guarding Your Heart Against Lust", "author": "Joshua Harris", "series": "", "ratings": "3144", "reviews": "156", "rating": "4.03", "description": "Harris, author of \"I Kissed Dating Goodbye,\" calls a generation bombarded with images of sexual sin back to the freedom and joy of holiness in this PG-rated book.\nHarris, author of \"I Kissed Dating Goodbye,\" calls a generation bombarded with images of sexual sin back to the freedom and joy of holiness in this PG-rated book.\n", "genres": ["Relationships", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Marriage", "Christian Living", "Theology", "Christian Non Fiction", "Christianity", "Counselling", "Christian", "Religion"]}, "7795022": {"bookid": "7795022", "title": "In Your Eyes", "author": "Adelle Laudan", "series": "", "ratings": "27", "reviews": "7", "rating": "3.63", "description": "Romantic Suspense, Biker Fiction, Contemporary.

Not so, lately. Four women have disappeared from Cleary over the past two years. And there\u2019s always a blue ribbon left near the spot where each of the women was last seen. There are no bodies, no other clues, and no suspicion as to who their abductor might be. And now, another woman has disappeared without a trace. It is to this backdrop that Lilly Martin returns to close the sale of her mountain cabin, marking the end of her turbulent eight-year marriage to Dutch Burton, Cleary\u2019s chief of police. Dutch\u2019s reluctance to let her go isn\u2019t Lilly\u2019s only obstacle. As she\u2019s trying to outrun a snowstorm, her car skids on the icy road and strikes a man who emerges from the woods on foot. She recognizes the injured man as Ben Tierney, whom she\u2019d met the previous summer.

Her marriage to a successful attorney has settled into a comfortable routine, and being the mother of two adorable sons has been rewarding. But Kelly's own passions lie wasted. She eyes with envy the lives of her two best friends, Kathryn and Charlotte, both beautiful, successful businesswomen who seem to have it all. Kelly takes charge of her life, devising a midlife makeover plan. From page one, Kelly's witty reflections, self-deprecating humor, and clever tactics in executing that plan--she places Post-it notes all over her house and car--will have readers laughing out loud. The next instant, however, they might rant right along with Kelly as her commitment to a sullen, anorexic teenager left on her doorstep tries her patience or as she deflects the boozy advances of a divorced neighbor.

Confronting killers with a combination of diplomacy, flattery, and deception, he offered shelter to more than twelve thousand members of the Tutsi clan and Hutu moderates, while homicidal mobs raged outside with machetes.An Ordinary Man explores what the Academy Award-nominated film Hotel Rwanda could not: the inner life of the man who became one of the most prominent public faces of that terrible conflict. Rusesabagina tells for the first time the full story of his life - growing up as the son of a rural farmer, the child of a mixed marriage, his extraordinary career path which led him to become the first Rwandan manager of the Belgian-owned Hotel Milles Collines - all of which contributed to his heroic actions in the face of such horror. He will also bring the reader inside the hotel for those one hundred terrible days depicted in the film, relating the anguish of those who watched as their loved ones were hacked to pieces and the betrayal that he felt as a result of the UN\u2019s refusal to help at this time of crisis.Including never-before-reported details of the Rwandan genocide, An Ordinary Man is sure to become a classic of tolerance literature, joining such books as Thomas Keneally\u2019s Schindler\u2019s List, Nelson Mandela\u2019s Long Walk to Freedom, and Elie Wiesel\u2019s Night.

Using a wealth of examples, from ancient myths and folk tales via the plays and novels of great literature to the popular movies and TV soap operas of today, it shows that there are seven archetypal themes which recur throughout every kind of storytelling. But this is only the prelude to an investigation into how and why we are 'programmed' to imagine stories in these ways, and how they relate to the inmost patterns of human psychology. Drawing on a vast array of examples, from Proust to detective stories, from the Marquis de Sade to E.T., Christopher Booker then leads us through the extraordinary changes in the nature of storytelling over the past 200 years, and why so many stories have 'lost the plot' by losing touch with their underlying archetypal purpose. Booker analyses why evolution has given us the need to tell stories and illustrates how storytelling has provided a uniquely revealing mirror to mankind's psychological development over the past 5000 years.This seminal book opens up in an entirely new way our understanding of the real purpose storytelling plays in our lives, and will be a talking point for years to come.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Literature", "Culture", "Reference", "Literary Criticism", "Writing", "Criticism", "Humanities", "Books About Books", "Film", "Language"]}, "8537327": {"bookid": "8537327", "title": "Inside Out & Back Again", "author": "Thanhha Lai", "series": "", "ratings": "53869", "reviews": "7482", "rating": "4.12", "description": "For all the ten years of her life, H\u00e0 has only known Saigon: the thrills of its markets, the joy of its traditions, and the warmth of her friends close by.

But when he exposed the corrupt oligarchs who were robbing the companies in which he was investing, Vladimir Putin turned on him and, in 2005, had him expelled from Russia. In 2007, a group of law enforcement officers raided Browder's offices in Moscow and stole $230 million of taxes that his fund's companies had paid to the Russian government. Browder's attorney Sergei Magnitsky investigated the incident and uncovered a sprawling criminal enterprise.

Leaky \nNational BestsellerDoctor of Natural Medicine and wellness authority Dr. Josh Axe delivers a groundbreaking, indispensable guide for understanding, diagnosing, and treating one of the most discussed yet little-understood health conditions: leaky gut syndrome.Do you have a leaky gut? For 80% of the population the answer is \u201cyes\u201d\u2014and most people don\u2019t even realize it. Leaky gut syndrome is the root cause of a litany of ailments, including: chronic inflammation, allergies, autoimmune diseases, hypothyroidism, adrenal fatigue, diabetes, and even arthritis.To keep us in good health, our gut relies on maintaining a symbiotic relationship with trillions of microorganisms that live in our digestive tract. When our digestive system is out of whack, serious health problems can manifest and our intestinal walls can develop microscopic holes, allowing undigested food particles, bacteria, and toxins to seep into the bloodstream. This condition is known as leaky gut syndrome.In Eat Dirt, Dr. Josh Axe explains that what we regard as modern \u201cimprovements\u201d to our food supply\u2014including refrigeration, sanitation, and modified grains\u2014have damaged our intestinal health. In fact, the same organisms in soil that allow plants and animals to flourish are the ones we need for gut health. In Eat Dirt, Dr. Axe explains that it\u2019s essential to get a little \u201cdirty\u201d in our daily lives in order to support our gut bacteria and prevent leaky gut syndrome. Dr. Axe offers simple ways to get these needed microbes, from incorporating local honey and bee pollen into your diet to forgoing hand sanitizers and even ingesting a little probiotic-rich soil.Because leaky gut manifests differently in every individual, Dr. Axe also identifies the five main \u201cgut types\u201d and offers customizable plans\u2014including diet, supplement, and lifestyle recommendations\u2014to dramatically improve gut health in just thirty days. With a simple diet plan, recipes, and practical advice, Eat Dirt will help readers restore gut health and eliminate leaky gut for good.\n", "genres": ["Cookbooks", "Science", "Nonfiction", "Medical", "Food", "Self Help", "Food and Drink", "Health", "Audiobook", "Nutrition", "Unfinished"]}, "1302582": {"bookid": "1302582", "title": "A Bird in the House", "author": "Margaret Laurence", "series": "(Manawaka Sequence)", "ratings": "2555", "reviews": "115", "rating": "3.93", "description": "One of Canada\u2019s most accomplished authors combines the best qualities of both the short story and the novel to create a lyrical evocation of the beauty, pain, and wonder of growing up.In eight interconnected, finely wrought stories, Margaret Laurence recreates the world of Vanessa MacLeod \u2013 a world of scrub-oak, willow, and chokecherry bushes; of family love and conflict; \nOne of Canada\u2019s most accomplished authors combines the best qualities of both the short story and the novel to create a lyrical evocation of the beauty, pain, and wonder of growing up.In eight interconnected, finely wrought stories, Margaret Laurence recreates the world of Vanessa MacLeod \u2013 a world of scrub-oak, willow, and chokecherry bushes; of family love and conflict; and of a girl\u2019s growing awareness of and passage into womanhood.

But if word of the existence of this endangered species gets out, it will destroy any chance of InterWest, a multi-national natural gas company, building an oil pipeline that would bring the company billions of dollars across Wyoming, through the mountains and forests of Twelve Sleep.

The playing field for Whites and Blacks is not equal, whether in education, science and technology, life expectancy, earning, or social strata. Blacks have been discriminated against and excluded based on their skin color, which creates the question of what their place is in America.There exist persistent Black inequalities in the structural make up of America; inequalities not inherent due to the differences in the abilities of Whites and Blacks but instead, due to the differences in access to opportunities between the two groups.Black workers in corporate America have to grapple with racial microaggressions in the workplace, which often involves White workers assuming that their Black counterparts are intellectually inferior to them. Thus, Blacks are passed over when important decisions are being made because of the belief that they have nothing intellectual to bring to the table; a phenomenon that is an obstacle to the upward mobility of Blacks in different organizations.\"Thriving While Black\" portrays that Blacks are Americans too and should not have to be seen as less and unequal! Their humanity should not be reduced to mere negative stereotypes. If America truly prides itself in diversity, there shouldn't be a forced need for Blacks to adopt mainstream White culture, hair styling, speech mannerisms, dress codes, etc., and neglect their own African-American identity just to fit into corporate America. The beauty of diversity is not gathering different and diverse people and trying to make them act the same way. Instead, it is bringing diverse people together and allowing their diversity to thrive.

It's just not easy being an ethical serial killer - especially while trying to avoid the unshakable suspicions of the dangerous Sergeant Doakes (who believes Dexter is a homicidal maniac...which, of course, he is). In an attempt to throw Doakes off his trail, Dexter has had to slip deep into his foolproof disguise. While not working as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, he now spends nearly all his time with his cheerful girlfriend, Rita, and her two children, sipping light beer and slowly becoming the world's first serial couch potato. But how long can Dexter play Kick the Can instead of Slice the Slasher? How long before his Dark Passenger forces him to drop the charade and let his inner monster run free?In trying times, opportunity knocks. A particularly nasty psychopath is cutting a trail through Miami - a man whose twisted technique leaves even Dexter speechless. As Dexter's dark appetite is revived, his sister, Deborah (a newly minted, tough-as-nails Miami detective), is drawn headlong into the case. It quickly becomes clear that it will take a monster to catch a monster - but it isn't until his archnemesis is abducted that Dex can finally throw himself into the search for a new plaything.

This is a book about visionary companies.\" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time.Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?\"What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked?By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Buisness", "Self Help", "Finance", "Leadership", "Management", "Personal Development", "Economics", "Business", "Entrepreneurship"]}, "109509": {"bookid": "109509", "title": "The Afghan", "author": "Frederick Forsyth", "series": "", "ratings": "12853", "reviews": "696", "rating": "3.73", "description": "A chilling story of modern terrorism from the grandmaster of international intrigue.

He is divorced, involved in a rather one-sided relationship with a bank clerk, and he is depressed. To lift his depression, a colleague suggests he rent a certain video. Tertuliano watches the film and is unimpressed. During the night, noises in his apartment wake him. He goes into the living room to find that the VCR is replaying the video, and as he watches in astonishment, he sees an actor who looks exactly like him - or, more specifically, exactly like the man he was five years before, moustachioed and fuller in the face. He sleeps badly.Against his own better judgement, Tertuliano decides to pursue his double. As he establishes the man's identity, what begins as a whimsical story becomes a dark meditation on identity and, perhaps, on the crass assumptions behind cloning - that we are merely our outward appearance rather than the sum of our experiences.\n", "genres": ["Literature", "Magical Realism", "Fantasy", "European Literature", "Portugal", "Cultural", "Fiction", "Novels", "Nobel Prize", "Contemporary", "Classics", "Portuguese Literature"]}, "279221": {"bookid": "279221", "title": "Peer Gynt", "author": "Henrik Ibsen", "series": "", "ratings": "7538", "reviews": "313", "rating": "3.70", "description": "Among the masterpieces of world literature, this early verse drama by the celebrated Norwegian playwright humorously yet profoundly explores the virtues, vices, and follies common to all humanity \u2014 as represented in the person of Peer Gynt, a charming but irresponsible young peasant.

Based on Norwegian folklore and Ibsen\u2019s own imaginative inventions, the play relates the roguish life of the world-wandering Peer, who finds wealth and fame \u2014 but never happiness \u2014 although he is redeemed by love in the end. As the play opens the young farmer attends a wedding and meets Solveig, the woman who is eventually to be his salvation. However, the rascally Peer then kidnaps the bride and later abandons her in the wilderness. This dismal performance is followed by a string of adventures (many of which do not reflect well on Peer) in many lands. After these soul-chilling exploits, an old and embittered Peer returns to Norway, eventually finding solace in the arms of the faithful Solveig. Like other early Ibsen plays, such as Brand (1865) and Emperor and Galilean (1873), the work is imbued with poetic mysticism and romanticism, and in Peer we find a rebellious central character in search of an ultimate truth that always seems just out of reach. In this sense Peer can be seen as an alter ego of Ibsen himself, whose lifelong search for artistic and moral certainties resulted in the great later plays (Hedda Gabler, The Wild Duck, An Enemy of the People, etc.) upon which his reputation chiefly rests. This rich, poetic version of Peer Gynt is considered the standard translation.\n", "genres": ["Poetry", "Literature", "Scandinavian Literature", "Fantasy", "European Literature", "Fiction", "19th Century", "Plays", "Theatre", "Classics", "Drama"]}, "17340050": {"bookid": "17340050", "title": "Losing Hope", "author": "Colleen Hoover", "series": "(Hopeless #2)", "ratings": "116547", "reviews": "8394", "rating": "4.31", "description": "In the follow-up to Colleen Hoover\u2019s #1 New York Times bestseller Hopeless, the charming and irresistible Dean Holder tells the passionate story that has melted thousands of hearts.In Hopeless, Sky left no secret unearthed, no feeling unshared, and no memory forgotten, but Holder\u2019s past remained a mystery.Still haunted by the little girl he let walk away, Holder has spent \nIn the follow-up to Colleen Hoover\u2019s #1 New York Times bestseller Hopeless, the charming and irresistible Dean Holder tells the passionate story that has melted thousands of hearts.In Hopeless, Sky left no secret unearthed, no feeling unshared, and no memory forgotten, but Holder\u2019s past remained a mystery.Still haunted by the little girl he let walk away, Holder has spent his entire life searching for her in an attempt to finally rid himself of the crushing guilt he has felt for years.

The novel is counted as one of 100 best books of the 20th century.Joseph Conrad (1857-1924), was a Polish author who wrote in English after settling in England. Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English, though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties. He wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent world. He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English tragic sensibility into English literature.Contents: Lord JimMemoirs & Letters:A Personal Record; or Some ReminiscencesThe Mirror of the SeaNotes on Life & LettersBiography & Critical Essays:Joseph Conrad (A Biography) by Hugh WalpoleJoseph Conrad by John Albert MacyA Conrad Miscellany by John Albert MacyJoseph Conrad by Virginia Woolf\n", "genres": ["British Literature", "Adventure", "Literature", "Classic Literature", "European Literature", "Historical", "Novels", "Fiction", "English Literature", "20th Century", "Historical Fiction", "Classics"]}, "25654398": {"bookid": "25654398", "title": "Demented (Sinister Tales, #1)", "author": "Anna Gallegos", "series": "", "ratings": "71", "reviews": "16", "rating": "4.65", "description": "These are short stories that will chill you to the bone and keep you checking over your shoulders.

Stay cool.No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it\u2019s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies\u2014before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she\u2019s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob\u2019s dismay, Harper wants to live\u2014at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads\u2014armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn\u2019t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter\u2019s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman\u2019s secrets before her life\u2014and that of her unborn child\u2014goes up in smoke.\n", "genres": ["Apocalyptic", "Post Apocalyptic", "Adult", "Fantasy", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Science Fiction", "Horror", "Dystopia"]}, "46000520": {"bookid": "46000520", "title": "The Thursday Murder Club", "author": "Richard Osman", "series": "(Thursday Murder Club #1)", "ratings": "197746", "reviews": "22585", "rating": "3.95", "description": "Four septuagenarians with a few tricks up their sleevesA female cop with her first big caseA brutal murderWelcome to\u2026The Thursday Murder ClubIn a peaceful retirement village, four unlikely friends meet weekly in the Jigsaw Room to discuss unsolved crimes; together they call themselves The Thursday Murder Club.

Despite a plethora of new translations in the second half of the twentieth century, the King James Version retains its power and appeal because \"it has the intrinsic value of a classic and is an enduring masterpiece.\"Drury outlines the fascinating history of this magisterial translation, marveling at the \"patient generosity\" with which the translators sifted through and distilled a century of previous scholarship. He points out that their work has endured not only because of the astonishing care they took to reflect faithfully the syntax of the original Hebrew and Greek\u2013which enabled them to dispense with the densely entangled prose style that characterized English writing at the time\u2013but also because of their concern to writers from Milton to Coleridge to George Eliot. From the doctrinal richness of the letters of St. Paul to those four masterpieces of storytelling, the Gospels, The New Testament has served as a source of inspiration for centuries.To quote George Steiner on the centrality of the Bible: \"What you have in hand is not a book.

A keepsake enjoyed by tea lovers for over a hundred years, The Book of Tea Classic Edition will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the seemingly simple act of making and drinking tea.In 1906 in turn-of-the-century Boston, a small, esoteric book about tea was written with the intention of being read aloud in the famous salon of Isabella Gardner, Boston's most notorious socialite. It was authored by Okakura Kakuzo, a Japanese philosopher, art expert, and curator. Little known at the time, Kakuzo would emerge as one of the great thinkers of the early 20th century, a genius who was insightful, witty\u2014and greatly responsible for bridging Western and Eastern cultures. Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was more than capable of expressing to Westerners the nuances of tea and the Japanese Tea Ceremony.In The Book of Tea Classic Edition, he discusses such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity. Kakuzo argues that tea-induced simplicity affected the culture, art and architecture of Japan.Nearly a century later, Kakuzo's The Book of Tea Classic Edition is still beloved the world over, making it an essential part of any tea enthusiast's collection. Interwoven with a rich history of Japanese tea and its place in Japanese society is a poignant commentary on Asian culture and our ongoing fascination with it, as well as illuminating essays on art, spirituality, poetry, and more. The Book of Tea Classic Edition is a delightful cup of enlightenment from a man far ahead of his time.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Asian Literature", "Japanese Literature", "Asia", "Food", "Philosophy", "Cultural", "Food and Drink", "History", "Tea", "Japan", "Art", "Classics"]}, "23016909": {"bookid": "23016909", "title": "The  Alternate Ending", "author": "M.J.

No longer willing to wait for the international community to stop its neighboring enemy, Israel launches one of the most creative and daring espionage operations ever conceived. The attack leaves a radioactive tomb and environmental disaster in the middle of Iran's second largest city. An outraged Iranian government publicly blames both Israel and the United States for the attack and demands retribution. Privately, Iran's bombastic president wants much more. He wants America and Israel to pay for their aggression with blood.Enter Mitch Rapp, America's top counterterrorism operative. Used to employing deception, Rapp sees an opportunity where others see only Iranian reprisals that could leave thousands of Americans dead. Rapp convinces President Josh Alexander to sign off on a risky operation that will further embarrass the Iranian government and push their country to the brink of revolution. As part of the plan, CIA director Irene Kennedy is dispatched to the region for a clandestine meeting with Azad Ashani, her Iranian counterpart.But Rapp isn't the only one hatching plans. Iran's President Amatullah has recruited Hezbollah master terrorist Imad Mukhtar to do his dirty work. For decades Mukhtar has acted as a surrogate for Iran, blazing a trail of death and destruction across the Middle East and beyond. When Kennedy's meeting with Ashani goes disastrously wrong, Rapp and Mukhtar are set on a collision course that threatens to engulf the entire region in war. With the clock ticking, Rapp is given twenty-four hours, no questions asked, to do whatever it takes to stop Mukhtar, and avert an unthinkable catastrophe.\n", "genres": ["Crime", "Suspense", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Action", "Espionage", "Audiobook", "Spy Thriller", "Mystery"]}, "6340948": {"bookid": "6340948", "title": "59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot", "author": "Richard Wiseman", "series": "", "ratings": "9980", "reviews": "708", "rating": "3.79", "description": "In \"59 Seconds,\" psychologist Professor Richard Wiseman presents a fresh approach to change that helps people achieve their aims and ambitions in minutes, not months.

If we embrace these elements, we can conjure more moments that matter. What if a teacher could design a lesson that he knew his students would remember twenty years later? What if a manager knew how to create an experience that would delight customers? What if you had a better sense of how to create memories that matter for your children? This book delves into some fascinating mysteries of experience: Why we tend to remember the best or worst moment of an experience, as well as the last moment, and forget the rest. Why \u201cwe feel most comfortable when things are certain, but we feel most alive when they\u2019re not.\u201d And why our most cherished memories are clustered into a brief period during our youth.

I believe we are all capable of it and furthermore that a small, often ignored corner of us positively yearns to try it. \u2014Stephen Fry, The Ode Less Travelled  Stephen Fry believes that if one can speak and read English, one can write poetry. Many of us have never been taught to read or write poetry and think of it as a mysterious and intimidating form. Or, if we have been taught, we remember uncomfortable silence when an English teacher invited the class to \"respond\" to a poem. In The Ode Less Travelled, Fry sets out to correct this problem by giving aspiring poets the tools and confidence they need to write poetry for pleasure.  Fry is a wonderfully engaging teacher and writer of poetry himself, and he explains the various elements of poetry in simple terms, without condescension. His enjoyable exercises and witty insights introduce the concepts of Metre, Rhyme, Form, Diction, and Poetics. Aspiring poets will learn to write a sonnet, on ode, a villanelle, a ballad, and a haiku, among others. Along the way, he introduces us to poets we've heard of, but never read. The Ode Less Travelled is a lively celebration of poetry that makes even the most reluctant reader want to pick up a pencil and give it a try.

It's not what you think. \n\nPlenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.David Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, Range makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.\n", "genres": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Self Help", "Personal Development", "Leadership", "Education", "Audiobook", "Productivity", "Business"]}, "171108": {"bookid": "171108", "title": "The Hatbox Letters", "author": "Beth Powning", "series": "", "ratings": "519", "reviews": "90", "rating": "3.11", "description": "A luminescent debut novel following one woman's journey through love, loss, grief, and renewalIn her rambling Victorian house, surrounded by heirloom gardens and the gentle sounds of a river, fifty-two-year-old Kate Harding faces her second winter since the untimely death of her husband.

Rudolf se sent trahi par le pr\u00eatre, seule personne au courant de l'\u00e9pisode, les autres croyant \u00e0 un accident.

Son p\u00e8re meurt peu avant la d\u00e9claration de guerre en 1914.\u00c0 seize ans, Lang d\u00e9bute sa carri\u00e8re militaire, d'abord en partant directement pour le front Ouest o\u00f9 il sera intercept\u00e9 puis renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re car il est trop jeune, puis comme aide \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital militaire o\u00f9 il rencontrera un dragon de cavalerie qui le persuadera de rentrer dans son unit\u00e9 et de partir sur le front en Turquie.\u00c0 la fin de la guerre, il se retrouve au ch\u00f4mage, rejet\u00e9 par sa famille. Il s'appr\u00eate \u00e0 se suicider lorsqu'un de ses coll\u00e8gues arrive et lui brandit un tract en lui disant de ne pas trahir l'Allemagne en se donnant la mort.Il adh\u00e8re au parti nazi et se voit confier la direction d'une ferme avec sa femme Elsie, o\u00f9 il vit des journ\u00e9es de dur labeur, mais paisibles. Puis, apr\u00e8s la prise du pouvoir par Hitler, il entre dans les SS, n'ayant pourtant pas les crit\u00e8res requis pour y adh\u00e9rer. Il acc\u00e8de \u00e0 des fonctions de plus en plus importantes dans la hi\u00e9rarchie SS, jusqu'\u00e0 devenir commandant du camp d'Auschwitz. Ce camp, d'abord de concentration, puis d'extermination, devient le lieu de la lente et t\u00e2tonnante mise au point de l'Usine de Mort du village d'Auschwitz.

Lang va s'attacher \u00e0 accomplir la mission qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e : tuer le plus grand nombre de Juifs et \u00e9liminer le plus efficacement possible les cadavres. Apr\u00e8s la guerre et la chute d'Hitler, il est emprisonn\u00e9, puis condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la pendaison apr\u00e8s son proc\u00e8s o\u00f9 il affirmera avoir seulement suivi les ordres, indiquant d'un air naturel qu'il a supervis\u00e9 et particip\u00e9 activement au meurtre de \u00ab seulement \u00bb 2,5 millions de personnes au lieu des 3,5 millions pr\u00e9vus3.Tout au long du livre, il se montre incapable de sentiments et m\u00eame d'action personnelle, car sa conduite lui a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 dict\u00e9e par un chef en qui il portait une confiance totale. \u00c0 la fin, on le sent cependant en col\u00e8re se disant trahi par Himmler, qui, tel un l\u00e2che, s'est suicid\u00e9, et n'a ainsi pas voulu assumer son r\u00f4le dans l'extermination des Juifs, laissant Rudolf seul responsable de ses actes.

We see how soil has shaped us and we have shaped soil\u2014as society after society has risen, prospered, and plowed through a natural endowment of fertile dirt. David R.

Explaining both who God is and how we can relate to him, Packer divides his book into three sections: The first directs our attention to how and why we know God, the second to the attributes of God and the third to the benefits enjoyed by a those who know him intimately. This guide leads readers into a greater understanding of God while providing advice to gaining a closer relationship with him as a result.\n", "genres": ["Faith", "Nonfiction", "Christian Living", "Spirituality", "Theology", "Christian Non Fiction", "Christianity", "Christian", "Classics", "Religion"]}, "80311": {"bookid": "80311", "title": "A Treatise of Human Nature", "author": "David Hume", "series": "(A Treatise of Human Nature #1-3)", "ratings": "11542", "reviews": "182", "rating": "3.93", "description": "A Treatise of Human Nature (1739-40), David Hume's comprehensive attempt to base philosophy on a new, observationally grounded study of human nature, is one of the most important texts in Western philosophy.

It is also the focal point of current attempts to understand 18th-century philosophy. The Treatise first explains how we form such concepts as cause and effect, external existence, and personal identity, and to form compelling but unconfirmable beliefs in the entities represented by these concepts. It then offers a novel account of the passions, explains freedom and necessity as they apply to human choices and actions, and concludes with detailed explanations of how we distinguish between virtue and vice and of the different kinds of virtue. Hume's Abstract of the Treatise, also included in the volume, outlines his 'chief argument' regarding our conception of, and belief in, cause and effect.

Laing explains how we all exist in the world as beings, defined by others who carry a model of us in their heads, just as we carry models of them in our heads. In later writings he often takes this to deeper levels, laboriously spelling out how \"A knows that B knows that A knows that B knows...\"! Our feelings and motivations derive very much from this condition of \"being in the world\" in the sense of existing for others, who exist for us. Without this we suffer \"ontological insecurity\", a condition often expressed in terms of \"being dead\" by people who are clearly still physically alive.This watershed work aimed to make madness comprehensible, and in doing so revolutionized the way we perceive mental illness. Using case studies of patients he had worked with, psychiatrist R. D. Laing argued that psychosis is not a medical condition, but an outcome of the 'divided self', or the tension between the two personas within us: one our authentic, private identity, and the other the false, 'sane' self that we present to the world. Laing's radical approach to insanity offered a rich existential analysis of personal alienation and made him a cult figure in the 1960s, yet his work was most significant for its humane attitude, which put the patient back at the centre of treatment.

Ed's answers to these 4 secrets shows that a specific type ofscientific design was used throughout the project of building ourcosmos; a design feature seen within atoms, planets, solar systems, and within the billions of galaxies. The notion of cosmic design doesset off a firestorm with many people. (Note: Detailed expandedanswers can be found in Ed's 4 previous cosmology books.

This suffering emerges in crippling self-judgments and conflicts in our relationships, in addictions and perfectionism, in loneliness and overwork--all the forces that keep our lives constricted and unfulfilled. Radical Acceptance offers a path to freedom, including the day-to-day practical guidance developed over Dr. Brach\u2019s twenty years of work with therapy clients and Buddhist students.Writing with great warmth and clarity, Tara Brach brings her teachings alive through personal stories and case histories, fresh interpretations of Buddhist tales, and guided meditations. Step by step, she leads us to trust our innate goodness, showing how we can develop the balance of clear-sightedness and compassion that is the essence of Radical Acceptance. Radical Acceptance does not mean self-indulgence or passivity. Instead it empowers genuine change: healing fear and shame and helping to build loving, authentic relationships. When we stop being at war with ourselves, we are free to live fully every precious moment of our lives.From the Hardcover edition.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Self Help", "Philosophy", "Personal Development", "Buddhism", "Spirituality", "Health", "Audiobook", "Mental Health", "Religion"]}, "13140": {"bookid": "13140", "title": "Jack & Jill", "author": "James Patterson", "series": "(Alex Cross #3)", "ratings": "75318", "reviews": "1845", "rating": "3.98", "description": "In the middle of the night, a controversial U.S. Senator is found murdered in bed in his Georgetown pied-a-terre.

But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, such an approach only perpetuates the one-way, \"cradle to grave\" manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective.Waste equals food. Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as \"biological nutrients\" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be \"technical nutrients\" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles, rather than being \"recycled\" -- really, downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well.\n", "genres": ["Biology", "Science", "Sustainability", "Nonfiction", "Ecology", "Architecture", "Green", "Economics", "Business", "Design", "Environment"]}, "8068272": {"bookid": "8068272", "title": "Intwine", "author": "Christina Moss", "series": "(Intwine #1)", "ratings": "99", "reviews": "26", "rating": "4.04", "description": "Not so very far away, and not too very long ago, in a small town called Burbank, on a tiny planet called Earth . . .

In the midst of this isolated bastion of democratic values, Miguel finds more than a new life\u2014 he finds someone to live for. Miren Ansotegui is a charismatic and graceful dancer who has her pick of the bachelors in Guernica, but focuses only on the charming and mysterious Miguel. The two discover a love that war and tragedy can not destroy.History and fiction merge seamlessly in this beautiful novel about the resilience of family, love, and tradition in the face of hardship. The bombing of Guernica was a devastating experiment in total warfare by the German Luftwaffe in the run-up to World War II. For Basques, it was an attack on the soul of their ancient nation; for the world, it was an unprecedented crime against humanity. In his first novel, Boling reintroduces the event and paints his own picture of a people so strong, vibrant, and proud that they are willing to do whatever it takes to protect their values, their country, and their loved ones.\n", "genres": ["Spanish Civil War", "Adult Fiction", "Book Club", "World War II", "Historical", "Cultural", "Novels", "Fiction", "Civil War", "War", "Historical Fiction", "Spain"]}, "7143322": {"bookid": "7143322", "title": "The Art of Devotion", "author": "Samantha Bruce-Benjamin", "series": "", "ratings": "228", "reviews": "77", "rating": "3.53", "description": "In the tradition of bestselling authors Ian McEwan and Anne Enright, Samantha Bruce-Benjamin\u2019s brilliant and timeless debut unveils the dark side of human nature as four women share the poignant tale of love, obsession, and ultimate betrayal that binds them forever.Have we all not wished to keep forever the one person we love the most?The secluded beaches of a sun-drenched\nIn the tradition of bestselling authors Ian McEwan and Anne Enright, Samantha Bruce-Benjamin\u2019s brilliant and timeless debut unveils the dark side of human nature as four women share the poignant tale of love, obsession, and ultimate betrayal that binds them forever.Have we all not wished to keep forever the one person we love the most?The secluded beaches of a sun-drenched Mediterranean island are the perfect playground for young Sebastian and Adora.

Readers learn quickly that each girl has her own writing style and that at two of the Brookfield boys (Seb and Charlie) seem to be smitten with Lydia and Emily. The only trouble is Cassie's pen pal, Matthew, a shady character who first sends her short, threatening letters and then becomes strangely sweet toward her. Nobody can figure out why Cassie keeps writing to him, but after she has a crushing meet-up with Matthew, Cassie discovers -- with the help of her friends and the Brookfield guys -- that he hasn't been honest about his identity. All could be ended there, but when Charlie helps take revenge and Brookfield High gets mysteriously vandalized, the group comes together to deliver justice and save the endangered pen pal project.Fresh and impressive, Moriarty's novel is lighthearted fare that will keep readers glued to the end.

Now, the book that reignited the feminist movement is back in a fifteenth anniversary edition, with a new preface by the author that brings backlash consciousness up to date. When it was first published, Backlash made headlines for puncturing such favorite media myths as the \u201cinfertility epidemic\u201d and the \u201cman shortage,\u201d myths that defied statistical realities. These willfully fictitious media campaigns added up to an antifeminist backlash. Whatever progress feminism has recently made, Faludi\u2019s words today seem prophetic. The media still love stories about stay-at-home moms and the \u201cdangers\u201d of women\u2019s career ambitions; the glass ceiling is still low; women are still punished for wanting to succeed; basic reproductive rights are still hanging by a thread. The backlash clearly exists.With passion and precision, Faludi shows in her new preface how the creators of commercial culture distort feminist concepts to sell products while selling women downstream, how the feminist ethic of economic independence is twisted into the consumer ethic of buying power, and how the feminist quest for self-determination is warped into a self-centered quest for self-improvement. Backlash is a classic of feminism, an alarm bell for women of every generation, reminding us of the dangers that we still face.\n", "genres": ["Social Movements", "Nonfiction", "Feminism", "Gender", "Politics", "Gender Studies", "History", "Womens", "Womens Studies", "Social Justice", "Sociology"]}, "918786": {"bookid": "918786", "title": "A Study in Scarlet / The Hound of the Baskervilles", "author": "Arthur Conan Doyle", "series": "", "ratings": "2749", "reviews": "82", "rating": "4.01", "description": "", "genres": ["British Literature", "Crime", "European Literature", "Historical", "Detective", "Victorian", "Fiction", "Novels", "Historical Fiction", "Mystery", "Classics"]}, "6193": {"bookid": "6193", "title": "Life and Times of Michael K", "author": "J.M.

From her comfortable home in Bielitz (present-day Bielsko) in Poland to her miraculous survival and her liberation by American troops\u2014including the man who was to become her husband\u2014in Volary, Czechoslovakia, in 1945, Gerda takes the reader on a terrifying journey. Gerda's serene and idyllic childhood is shattered when Nazis march into Poland on September 3, 1939. Although the Weissmanns were permitted to live for a while in the basement of their home, they were eventually separated and sent to German labor camps. Over the next few years Gerda experienced the slow, inexorable stripping away of \"all but her life.\" By the end of the war she had lost her parents, brother, home, possessions, and community; even the dear friends she made in the labor camps, with whom she had shared so many hardships, were dead. Despite her horrifying experiences, Klein conveys great strength of spirit and faith in humanity. In the darkness of the camps, Gerda and her young friends manage to create a community of friendship and love. Although stripped of the essence of life, they were able to survive the barbarity of their captors. Gerda's beautifully written story gives an invaluable message to everyone. It introduces them to last century's terrible history of devastation and prejudice, yet offers them hope that the effects of hatred can be overcome.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "World War II", "Holocaust", "Autobiography", "Historical", "History", "Biography Memoir", "Biography", "War", "Memoir"]}, "21704": {"bookid": "21704", "title": "The Black Dahlia", "author": "James Ellroy", "series": "(L.A.

He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature by embracing three linked dogmas: the Blank Slate (the mind has no innate traits), the Noble Savage (people are born good and corrupted by society), and the Ghost in the Machine (each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden, so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them.Pinker injects calm and rationality into these debates by showing that equality, progress, responsibility, and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about a rich human nature. He disarms even the most menacing threats with clear thinking, common sense, and pertinent facts from science and history.Despite its popularity among intellectuals during much of the twentieth century, he argues, the doctrine of the Blank Slate may have done more harm than good. It denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces hardheaded analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of government, violence, parenting, and the arts.Pinker shows that an acknowledgement of human nature that is grounded in science and common sense, far from being dangerous, can complement insights about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers. All this is done in the style that earned his previous books many prizes and worldwide acclaim: wit, lucidity, and insight into matters great and small.\n", "genres": ["Biology", "Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Politics", "Anthropology", "Philosophy", "Evolution", "Neuroscience", "Sociology"]}, "17408897": {"bookid": "17408897", "title": "I Am Princess X", "author": "Cherie Priest", "series": "", "ratings": "12543", "reviews": "2356", "rating": "4.06", "description": "Best friends, big fans, a mysterious webcomic, and a long-lost girl collide in this riveting novel, perfect for fans of both Cory Doctorow and Sarah Dessen; illustrated throughout with comics.Once upon a time, two best friends created a princess together.

Arianna Huffington's personal wake-up call came in the form of a broken cheekbone and a nasty gash over her eye -- the result of a fall brought on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. As the cofounder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group -- one of the fastest growing media companies in the world -- celebrated as one of the world's most influential women, and gracing the covers of magazines, she was, by any traditional measure, extraordinarily successful. Yet as she found herself going from brain MRI to CAT scan to echocardiogram, to find out if there was any underlying medical problem beyond exhaustion, she wondered is this really what success feels like? As more and more people are coming to realize, there is far more to living a truly successful life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office. Our relentless pursuit of the two traditional metrics of success -- money and power -- has led to an epidemic of burnout and stress-related illnesses, and an erosion in the quality of our relationships, family life, and, ironically, our careers. In being connected to the world 24/7, we're losing our connection to what truly matters. Our current definition of success is, as Thrive shows, literally killing us. We need a new way forward. In a commencement address Arianna gave at Smith College in the spring of 2013, she likened our drive for money and power to two legs of a three-legged stool. They may hold us up temporarily, but sooner or later we're going to topple over. We need a third leg -- a third metric for defining success -- to truly thrive. That third metric, she writes in Thrive, includes our well-being, our ability to draw on our intuition and inner wisdom, our sense of wonder, and our capacity for compassion and giving. As Arianna points out, our eulogies celebrate our lives very differently from the way society defines success. They don't commemorate our long hours in the office, our promotions, or our sterling PowerPoint presentations as we relentlessly raced to climb up the career ladder. They are not about our resumes -- they are about cherished memories, shared adventures, small kindnesses and acts of generosity, lifelong passions, and the things that made us laugh. In this deeply personal book, Arianna talks candidly about her own challenges with managing time and prioritizing the demands of a career and raising two daughters -- of juggling business deadlines and family crises, a harried dance that led to her collapse and to her \"aha moment.\" Drawing on the latest groundbreaking research and scientific findings in the fields of psychology, sports, sleep, and physiology that show the profound and transformative effects of meditation, mindfulness, unplugging, and giving, Arianna shows us the way to a revolution in our culture, our thinking, our workplace, and our lives.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Autobiography", "Self Help", "Personal Development", "Leadership", "Health", "Audiobook", "Biography", "Business", "Memoir"]}, "22688": {"bookid": "22688", "title": "The Other Woman", "author": "Eric Jerome Dickey", "series": "", "ratings": "7583", "reviews": "269", "rating": "4.30", "description": "Eric Jerome Dickey strides boldly over the minefield that is modern marriage.

This book will resonate in particular with those who have experience of such 'churches' or who wish to understand the mentality of people who lead and join such organisations. This is a fairly lengthy novel, inspired by real-life events, recounting true sentiments and experiences. The story follows the child, Megan, through a tumultuous upbringing and early religious experiences, into adulthood and the point when she falls into the company of a fundamentalist Christian group and becomes embroiled in their contradictory world of genuine miracles, fun and love; coupled with religious fanaticism, gross sexism and social control. With an open approach to some difficult topics, such as abuse, terminal illness and gender roles, some content may be contentious or painful to read. Eye-opening biblical scriptures are quoted to illustrate the basis for some of the characters' beliefs. This is a story of the making and breaking of precious friendships, of one woman's desire to find and understand her place in the world, healing for her past and a sense of self and purpose; and the price of that quest. Megan finds faith, loses it and rediscovers it, while experiencing the duality of others and eventually discovering the true source of miracles.\n", "genres": ["Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Suspense", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Novels", "Dark", "Psychological Thriller", "Mystery", "Drama"]}, "36064445": {"bookid": "36064445", "title": "Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life", "author": "Nassim Nicholas Taleb", "series": "(Incerto #5)", "ratings": "21357", "reviews": "2068", "rating": "3.89", "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of The Black Swan, a bold new work that challenges many of our long-held beliefs about risk and reward, politics and religion, finance and personal responsibility In his most provocative and practical book yet, one of the foremost thinkers of our time redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contri\nFrom the New York Times bestselling author of The Black Swan, a bold new work that challenges many of our long-held beliefs about risk and reward, politics and religion, finance and personal responsibility In his most provocative and practical book yet, one of the foremost thinkers of our time redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contribute to a fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one\u2019s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life. As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights: \u2022 For social justice,\u00a0focus on symmetry and risk sharing. You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations. \u2022 Ethical rules aren\u2019t universal. You\u2019re part of a group larger than you, but it\u2019s still smaller than humanity in general. \u2022 Minorities, not majorities, run the world. The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others. \u2022 You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot. \u201cEducated philistines\u201d have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets. \u2022 Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find). A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines. \u2022 True religion is commitment, not just faith. How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you\u2019re willing to risk for it.The phrase \u201cskin in the game\u201d is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it\u2019s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, \u201cThe symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that\u2019s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,\u201d and \u201cNever trust anyone who doesn\u2019t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.\u201d\n", "genres": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Politics", "Finance", "Philosophy", "Self Help", "Audiobook", "Economics", "Business"]}, "26114135": {"bookid": "26114135", "title": "All the Ugly and Wonderful Things", "author": "Bryn Greenwood", "series": "", "ratings": "127952", "reviews": "17106", "rating": "4.03", "description": "As the daughter of a meth dealer, Wavy knows not to trust people, not even her own parents.

A dream to become an actress, like her idols Ron Howard and Vicki Lawrence. But it was a long way from the South Side of Chicago to Hollywood, and it didn't help that she'd recently dropped out of the school play, The Ugly Duckling. Or that the Hollywood casting directors she wrote to replied that \"professional training was a requirement.\"  But the funny thing is, it all came true. Through a series of Happy Accidents, Jane Lynch created an improbable and hilarious path to success. In those early years, despite her dreams, she was also consumed with anxiety, feeling out of place in both her body and her family. To deal with her worries about her sexuality, she escaped in positive ways such as joining a high school chorus not unlike the one in Glee but also found destructive outlets. She started drinking almost every night her freshman year of high school and developed a mean and judgmental streak that turned her into a real- life Sue Sylvester. Then, at thirty-one, she started to get her life together. She was finally able to embrace her sexuality, come out to her parents, and quit drinking for good. Soon after, a Frosted Flakes commercial and a chance meeting in a coffee shop led to a role in the Christopher Guest movie Best in Show, which helped her get cast in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Similar coincidences and chance meetings led to roles in movies starring Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, and even Meryl Streep in 2009's Julie & Julia. Then, of course, came the two lucky accidents that truly changed her life. Getting lost in a hotel led to an introduction to her future wife, Lara. Then, a series she'd signed up for abruptly got canceled, making it possible for her to take the role of Sue Sylvester in Glee, which made her a megastar.  Today, Jane Lynch has finally found the contentment she thought she'd never have. Part comic memoir and part inspirational narrative, this is a book equally for the rabid Glee fan and for anyone who needs a new perspective on life, love, and success. WITH A FOREWORD BY CAROL BURNETT Excerpt from Happy Accidents:If I could go back in time and talk to my twenty-year-old self, the first thing I would say is: \"Lose the perm.\" Secondly I would say: \"Relax. Really. Just relax. Don't sweat it.\" I can't remember a time when I wasn't anxious and fearful that the parade would pass me by. And I was sure there was someone or something outside of myself with all the answers. I had a driving, anxiety-filled ambition. I wanted to be a working actor so badly. I wanted to belong and feel like I was valued and seen. Well, now I am a working actor, and I guarantee you it's not because I suffered or worried over it.  As I look back, the road to where I am today has been a series of happy accidents I was either smart or stupid enough to take advantage of. I thought I had to have a plan, a strategy. Turns out I just had to be ready and willing to take chances, look at what's right in front of me, and put my heart into everything I do. All that anxiety and fear didn't help, nor did it fuel anything useful. My final piece of advice to twenty-year-old me: Be easy on your sweet self.

Now Grossman takes us back to Fillory, where the Brakebills graduates have fled the sorrows of the mundane world, only to face terrifying new challenges.Quentin and his friends are now the kings and queens of Fillory, but the days and nights of royal luxury are starting to pall. After a morning hunt takes a sinister turn, Quentin and his old friend Julia charter a magical sailing ship and set out on an errand to the wild outer reaches of their kingdom. Their pleasure cruise becomes an adventure when the two are unceremoniously dumped back into the last place Quentin ever wants to see: his parent's house in Chesterton, Massachusetts. And only the black, twisted magic that Julia learned on the streets can save them.The Magician King is a grand voyage into the dark, glittering heart of magic, an epic quest for the Harry Potter generation. It also introduces a powerful new voice, that of Julia, whose angry genius is thrilling. Once again Grossman proves that he is the cutting edge of literary fantasy.\n", "genres": ["Adult", "Adventure", "Magic", "Fantasy", "Urban Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Contemporary"]}, "982572": {"bookid": "982572", "title": "Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara", "author": "R\u00f3mulo Gallegos", "series": "", "ratings": "4466", "reviews": "360", "rating": "3.79", "description": "Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara, en la que la llanura venezolana es el personaje central, es la obra de mayor \u00e9xito de R\u00f3mulo Gallegos.

To her surprise, her former rival for the Democratic Party nomination, newly elected President Barack Obama, asked her to serve in his administration as Secretary of State. This memoir is the story of the four extraordinary and historic years that followed, and the hard choices that she and her colleagues confronted.Secretary Clinton and President Obama had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East. Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harm\u2019s way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.By the end of her tenure, Secretary Clinton had visited 112 countries, traveled nearly one million miles, and gained a truly global perspective on many of the major trends reshaping the landscape of the twenty-first century, from economic inequality to climate change to revolutions in energy, communications, and health. Drawing on conversations with numerous leaders and experts, Secretary Clinton offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world. She makes a passionate case for human rights and the full participation in society of women, youth, and LGBT people. An astute eyewitness to decades of social change, she distinguishes the trendlines from the headlines and describes the progress occurring throughout the world, day after day.Secretary Clinton\u2019s descriptions of diplomatic conversations at the highest levels offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use \u201csmart power\u201d to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world\u2014one in which America remains the indispensable nation.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Feminism", "Politics", "Autobiography", "History", "Audiobook", "Biography Memoir", "Womens", "Biography", "Memoir"]}, "8718": {"bookid": "8718", "title": "Creation", "author": "Gore Vidal", "series": "", "ratings": "4119", "reviews": "364", "rating": "4.22", "description": "Once again the incomparable Gore Vidal interprets and animates history -- this time in a panoramic tour of the 5th century B.C. -- and embellishes it with his own ironic humor, brilliant insights, and piercing observations.

Out of sheer necessity, he developed a method called the Bullet Journal that helped him become consistently focused and effective. When he started sharing his system with friends who faced similar challenges, it went viral. Just a few years later, to his astonishment, Bullet Journaling is a global movement. The Bullet Journal Method is about much more than organizing your notes and to-do lists. It's about what Carroll calls \"intentional living:\" weeding out distractions and focusing your time and energy in pursuit of what's truly meaningful, in both your work and your personal life. It's about spending more time with what you care about, by working on fewer things. His new book shows you how to... \u2022 Track the past: Using nothing more than a pen and paper, create a clear and comprehensive record of your thoughts. \u2022 Order the present: Find daily calm by tackling your to-do list in a more mindful, systematic, and productive way. \u2022 Design the future: Transform your vague curiosities into meaningful goals, and then break those goals into manageable action steps that lead to big change. Carroll wrote this book for frustrated list-makers, overwhelmed multitaskers, and creatives who need some structure. Whether you've used a Bullet Journal for years or have never seen one before, The Bullet Journal Method will help you go from passenger to pilot of your own life.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Reference", "Self Help", "Diary", "Personal Development", "Productivity", "Journaling", "Writing", "Business", "How To", "Language"]}, "6377319": {"bookid": "6377319", "title": "Gaia and the New Politics of Love: Notes for a Poly Planet", "author": "Serena Anderlini-D'Onofrio", "series": "", "ratings": "10", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.50", "description": "***WINNER, 2010 Nautilus Silver Book Award \u2013 Cosmology/New ScienceGaia theory argues that the flora and fauna of the planet operate in a self-regulating web that keeps the world livable.

According to the theory, humankind is the most powerful species in this web and also its biggest threat. This provocative book explores ways to minimize and ultimately eliminate this threat with love and intimacy. Controversial Italian author Serena Anderlini-D\u2019Onofrio has authored the first global ecology study based on an analysis of human health. Anderlini-D\u2019Onofrio identifies her remedy within the context of Gaia theory, re-envisioning it as a more inclusive philosophy that positively impacts not only relationships, but world ecology under duress. The author links human sexuality to the global ecosystem, claiming that freedom from fear will stimulate a holistic health movement powerful enough to heal relationships and restore planetary balance.Gaia and the New Politics of Love is bracing in its range, weaving together issues of human and global health; the relationship of politics, sexuality, and ecology; practices and styles of love; the changing roles of eroticism and gender in our lives; and polyamory, bisexuality, and the AIDS reappraisal movement.Clarification Statement from the AuthorThe argument of this book emphasizes the arts of loving as a way to help humanity make peace with our hostess Gaia, the third planet. Some of these arts involve sharing emotional resources and amorous partners.Often, the arts of loving require the use of barriers: mechanical protections such as condoms. At times they do not because only tantric energies are exchanged. The author of this book is persuaded that barriers are recommendable when sexual practices result in the exchange of deep body fluids, unless previous fluid-bonding arrangements have been made. The author is also persuaded that good practices of holistic health contribute to strengthening the immune systems of those who engage in the arts of loving.Safety practices are important in making the arts of loving healthy regardless of what factors are involved in the syndromes most prevalent today, including AIDS and other conditions in the STD spectrum. Historically, disagreement has moved knowledge forward: Today\u2019s science is the result of yesterday\u2019s disagreements and controversies. The author believes in critical thinking and she respects dissidence in science today, including Gaia science, reappraisals of AIDS, and holistic medicine. She hopes her readers will be open to hearing more than one side of a story.This statement and the contents of this book do not constitute medical advice in any way. Readers are invited to consult their own healers and health care providers.Serena Anderlini-D\u2019Onofrio, PhDAuthor of Gaia and the New Politics of LoveCabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, March 2010Blog: http://polyplanet.blogspot.com/\n", "genres": ["Sexuality", "Nonfiction", "Polyamory", "Sociology"]}, "140181": {"bookid": "140181", "title": "Zen Shorts", "author": "Jon J.

There has been much international excitement too-to date, rights have been sold in thirteen countries. Wolf Totem is set in 1960s China-the time of the Great Leap Forward, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution.  Searching for spirituality, Beijing intellectual Chen Zhen travels to the pristine grasslands of Inner Mongolia to live among the nomadic Mongols-a proud, brave, and ancient race of people who coexist in perfect harmony with their unspeakably beautiful but cruel natural surroundings. Their philosophy of maintaining a balance with nature is the ground stone of their religion, a kind of cult of the wolf.  The fierce wolves that haunt the steppes of the unforgiving grassland searching for food are locked with the nomads in a profoundly spiritual battle for survival-a life-and-death dance that has gone on between them for thousands of years. The Mongols believe that the wolf is a great and worthy foe that they are divinely instructed to contend with, but also to worship and to learn from. Chen's own encounters with the otherworldly wolves awake a latent primitive instinct in him, and his fascination with them blossoms into obsession, then reverence.  After many years, the peace is shattered with the arrival of Chen's kinfolk, Han Chinese, sent from the cities to bring modernity to the grasslands. They immediately launch a campaign to exterminate the wolves, sending the balance that has been maintained with religious dedication for thousands of years into a spiral leading to extinction-first the wolves, then the Mongol culture, finally the land. As a result of the eradication of the wolves, rats become a plague and wild sheep graze until the meadows turn to dust. Mongolian dust storms glide over Beijing, sometimes blocking out the moon.  Part period epic, part fable for modern days, Wolf Totem is a stinging social commentary on the dangers of China's overaccelerated economic growth as well as a fascinating immersion into the heart of Chinese culture.\n", "genres": ["Literature", "Asian Literature", "Animals", "Historical", "Cultural", "China", "Fiction", "Chinese Literature", "Novels", "Contemporary", "Historical Fiction", "Asia"]}, "50039": {"bookid": "50039", "title": "I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie", "author": "Pamela Des Barres", "series": "", "ratings": "17493", "reviews": "895", "rating": "3.68", "description": "The stylish, exuberant, and remarkably sweet confession of one of the most famous groupies of the 1960s and 70s is back in print in this new edition that includes an afterword on the author's last 15 years of adventures.

And on an extraordinary odyssey with no promise of return, many lessons will be learned--as dragons and tenders alike experience hardships, betrayals . . . and joys beyond their wildest imaginings.\n", "genres": ["Adult", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Dragons", "Epic", "High Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy"]}, "33385438": {"bookid": "33385438", "title": "The Child Finder", "author": "Rene Denfeld", "series": "(Naomi Cottle #1)", "ratings": "38992", "reviews": "4845", "rating": "3.96", "description": "A haunting, atmospheric, and deeply suspenseful novel from the acclaimed author of The Enchanted about an investigator who must use her unique insights to find a missing little girl.\"Where are you, Madison Culver?

In his new book, Stillness Is the Key, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you.In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus.Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. Stillness Is the Key offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media. The stillness that we all seek is the path to meaning, contentment, and excellence in a world that needs more of it than ever.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Self Help", "Philosophy", "Personal Development", "Leadership", "Spirituality", "Audiobook", "Productivity", "Business"]}, "18889": {"bookid": "18889", "title": "Lady of Avalon", "author": "Marion Zimmer Bradley", "series": "(Avalon #3)", "ratings": "16782", "reviews": "333", "rating": "3.91", "description": "Set in the time before King Arthur, this novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley brings the mesmerizing world of Avalon brilliantly to life with epic grandeur-telling the story of three remarkable women who alter the fortunes of Roman Britain as they fight to reclaim the magic and traditions of a once glorious ", "genres": ["Mythology", "Magic", "Fantasy", "Historical", "Romance", "Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Historical Fantasy", "Arthurian", "Historical Fiction"]}, "90761": {"bookid": "90761", "title": "Legs", "author": "William  Kennedy", "series": "(The Albany Cycle #1)", "ratings": "1752", "reviews": "109", "rating": "3.80", "description": "Legs, the inaugural book in William Kennedy\u2019s acclaimed Albany cycle of novels, brilliantly evokes the flamboyant career of gangster Jack \u201cLegs\u201d Diamond.\u00a0 Through the equivocal eyes of Diamond\u2019s attorney, Marcus Gorman (who scraps a promising political career for the more elemental excitement of the criminal underworld), we watch as Legs and his showgirl mistress, Kiki Rob\nLegs, the inaugural book in William Kennedy\u2019s acclaimed Albany cycle of novels, brilliantly evokes the flamboyant career of gangster Jack \u201cLegs\u201d Diamond.\u00a0 Through the equivocal eyes of Diamond\u2019s attorney, Marcus Gorman (who scraps a promising political career for the more elemental excitement of the criminal underworld), we watch as Legs and his showgirl mistress, Kiki Roberts, blaze their gaudy trail across the tabloid pages of the 1920s and 1930s.\n", "genres": ["American Fiction", "Literature", "Crime", "Historical", "Novels", "Fiction", "American", "New York", "20th Century", "Historical Fiction", "Mystery"]}, "8255917": {"bookid": "8255917", "title": "Washington: A Life", "author": "Ron Chernow", "series": "", "ratings": "65268", "reviews": "2735", "rating": "4.11", "description": "The celebrated Ron Chernow provides a richly nuanced portrait of the father of America.

He portrays Washington as a strapping, celebrated horseman, elegant dancer and tireless hunter, who guarded his emotional life with intriguing ferocity. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age, including James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, he orchestrated their actions to help realise his vision for the new federal government, define the separation of powers, and establish the office of the presidency.Ron Chernow takes us on a page-turning journey through all the formative events of America's founding.

The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That\u2019s how this extraordinary autobiography began. Over the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humor, and originality found in his songs. He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger, and darkness that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as \u201cThe Big Bang\u201d: seeing Elvis Presley\u2019s debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work, and shows us why the song \u201cBorn to Run\u201d reveals more than we previously realized. Born to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen, but this book is much more than a legendary rock star\u2019s memoir. This is a book for workers and dreamers, parents and children, lovers and loners, artists, freaks, or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll.

In A Guide to the Good Life, William B. Irvine plumbs the wisdom of Stoic philosophy, one of the most popular and successful schools of thought in ancient Rome, and shows how its insight and advice are still remarkably applicable to modern lives. In A Guide to the Good Life, Irvine offers a refreshing presentation of Stoicism, showing how this ancient philosophy can still direct us toward a better life. Using the psychological insights and the practical techniques of the Stoics, Irvine offers a roadmap for anyone seeking to avoid the feelings of chronic dissatisfaction that plague so many of us. Irvine looks at various Stoic techniques for attaining tranquility and shows how to put these techniques to work in our own life. As he does so, he describes his own experiences practicing Stoicism and offers valuable first-hand advice for anyone wishing to live better by following in the footsteps of these ancient philosophers. Readers learn how to minimize worry, how to let go of the past and focus our efforts on the things we can control, and how to deal with insults, grief, old age, and the distracting temptations of fame and fortune. We learn from Marcus Aurelius the importance of prizing only things of true value, and from Epictetus we learn how to be more content with what we have. Finally, A Guide to the Good Life shows readers how to become thoughtful observers of their own life. If we watch ourselves as we go about our daily business and later reflect on what we saw, we can better identify the sources of distress and eventually avoid that pain in our life. By doing this, the Stoics thought, we can hope to attain a truly joyful life.\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Self Help", "Philosophy", "Personal Development", "Spirituality", "History", "Audiobook", "Health", "Business"]}, "912687": {"bookid": "912687", "title": "Charleston", "author": "John Jakes", "series": "", "ratings": "3535", "reviews": "185", "rating": "3.92", "description": "No missing pages, Water Damage, or stains.

Lee's obsession with the crime begins a story that weaves through the decades, following the life of a small southern town and the role of three police chiefs in unraveling the crime. Chiefs is the best kind of thriller, where the investigation plays out against the drama beneath the surface of a seemingly placid community, seething with the pressures of race, love, hate, and; always; political power, extending from the town fathers all the way to Washington, DC. With a new foreword by the author, this volume will be a collector's treasure for all fans of Stuart Woods.\n", "genres": ["Emergency Services", "Police", "Crime", "Historical", "Mystery Thriller", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Suspense", "Audiobook", "Historical Fiction", "Mystery"]}, "58174": {"bookid": "58174", "title": "Promise at Dawn", "author": "Romain Gary", "series": "", "ratings": "8133", "reviews": "606", "rating": "4.27", "description": "'Promise at Dawn' begins as the story of a mother's sacrifice.

She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless.

The Undercover Economist is for anyone who's wondered why the gap between rich and poor nations is so great, or why they can't seem to find a decent second-hand car, or how to outwit Starbucks. This book offers the hidden story behind these and other questions, as economist Tim Harford ranges from Africa, Asia, Europe, and of course the United States to reveal how supermarkets, airlines, and coffee chains--to name just a few--are vacuuming money from our wallets. Harford punctures the myths surrounding some of today's biggest controversies, including the high cost of health-care; he reveals why certain environmental laws can put a smile on a landlord's face; and he explains why some industries can have high profits for innocent reasons, while in other industries something sinister is going on. Covering an array of economic concepts including scarce resources, market power, efficiency, price gouging, market failure, inside information, and game theory, Harford sheds light on how these forces shape our day-to-day lives, often without our knowing it.  Showing us the world through the eyes of an economist, Tim Harford reveals that everyday events are intricate games of negotiations, contests of strength, and battles of wits. Written with a light touch and sly wit, The Undercover Economist turns \"the dismal science\" into a true delight.\n", "genres": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Politics", "Finance", "Social Science", "Audiobook", "Economics", "Business", "Sociology"]}, "11851522": {"bookid": "11851522", "title": "The Complete Works of H.P.

In medieval Cambridge, England, four children have been murdered. The crimes are immediately blamed on the town's Jewish community, taken as evidence that Jews sacrifice Christian children in blasphemous ceremonies. To save them from the rioting mob, the king places the Cambridge Jews under his protection and hides them in a castle fortress. King Henry II is no friend of the Jews-or anyone, really-but he is invested in their fate. Without the taxes received from Jewish merchants, his treasuries would go bankrupt. Hoping scientific investigation will exonerate the Jews, Henry calls on his cousin the King of Sicily-whose subjects include the best medical experts in Europe-and asks for his finest \"master of the art of death,\" an early version of the medical examiner. The Italian doctor chosen for the task is a young prodigy from the University of Salerno. But her name is Adelia-the king has been sent a \"mistress\" of the art of death. Adelia and her companions-Simon, a Jew, and Mansur, a Moor-travel to England to unravel the mystery of the Cambridge murders, which turn out to be the work of a serial killer, most likely one who has been on Crusade with the king. In a backward and superstitious country like England, Adelia must conceal her true identity as a doctor in order to avoid accusations of witchcraft. Along the way, she is assisted by Sir Rowley Picot, one of the king's tax collectors, a man with a personal stake in the investigation. Rowley may be a needed friend, or the fiend for whom they are searching. As Adelia's investigation takes her into Cambridge's shadowy river paths and behind the closed doors of its churches and nunneries, the hunt intensifies and the killer prepares to strike again . .\n", "genres": ["British Literature", "Crime", "European Literature", "Historical", "Mystery Thriller", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Medieval", "Historical Mystery", "Historical Fiction", "Mystery"]}, "134025": {"bookid": "134025", "title": "The Complete English Poems", "author": "John Donne", "series": "(The Folio Poets #5)", "ratings": "9624", "reviews": "96", "rating": "4.15", "description": "Yet it is only this century that Donne has been indisputably established as a great poet\u2014and even, many feel, the greatest love poet of them all.

Jonson went on to remark that 'That Donne, for not keeping of an accent, deserved hanging', yet Donne's rhythms, once thought 'unmusical' are now recognized as the natural rhythms of the speaking voice; his 'eccentricity' as a complex self-doubt; his 'obscurity' the reflection of a brilliantly learned and allusive mind.

Keeping a vigilant watch over our leaders in Washington D.C., the club has won some allies, but it has also earned formidable enemies-including those in power who will do anything to prevent Stone and his friends from uncovering some of the hidden, secret work of the government.Annabelle Conroy, an honorary member of the Camel Club, is also the greatest con artist of her generation. She has swindled more than forty million dollars from casino king Jerry Bagger, the man who murdered her mother. Now he's hot on her trail with only one goal in mind: Annabelle's death. But as Stone and the Camel Club circle the wagons to protect Annabelle, a new opponent, who makes Bagger's menace pale by comparison, suddenly arises.One by one, men from Stone's shadowy past are turning up dead. Behind this slaughter stands one man: Harry Finn. To almost all who know him, Finn is a doting father and loving husband who uses his skills behind the scenes to keep our nation safe. But the other face of Harry Finn is that of an unstoppable killer who inevitably sets his lethal bull's-eye on Oliver Stone. And with Finn, Stone may well have met his match.As Annabelle and the Camel Club fight for their lives, the twists and turns whipsaw. It leads to a finale that is as explosive as it is shattering.

It guides readers through the journey in a step by step progression, from ancient prophecies to their final fulfillment. The Message for the Last Days maps out God's intersection of our temporary condition to the eternal.The future is revealed by understanding the past; where history and mystery are intertwined.How can we know what the future holds if we don't understand the past? This question is at the heart of this book as much of modern Christian culture has lost its roots. The crux of the book is derived from consistent biblical interpretation methods to find hard truths about our fate mentioned in the Bible.Topics include answers to these questions:Why is the Christian Church so divided with many different denominations and independent Churches? Isn\u2019t there just one true Church?How did the modern Church get so far removed from early Church beliefs as clearly stated in the New Testament and by the early Church fathers?What are the original prophecies in the Old Testament about the end times and how are they repeated in the New Testament?Does the nation of Israel have anything to do with end times? What is the true meaning of the gospel and salvation?These questions are answered by a thorough examination of various interpretation methods. This book explains six different biblical interpretation options then reveals a unified approach to understanding the Bible.Books and articles by KJ Soze cut across various denomination lines to help find unity and clarity for those who may hold differing interpretations.The Message for the Last Days provides detailed historical research of complex topics, such as end times and the afterlife, then condenses the results into a compact format to save time for those interested in biblical studies. The process is an integration of scriptural references, concordances, topical studies and commentaries into a unique package to help clarify the Bible's message about the future.\n", "genres": ["Contemporary", "Christian", "Book Club"]}, "23638955": {"bookid": "23638955", "title": "Pretty Baby", "author": "Mary Kubica", "series": "", "ratings": "51227", "reviews": "4522", "rating": "3.74", "description": "A chance encounter sparks an unrelenting web of lies in this stunning new psychological thriller from national bestselling author Mary KubicaShe sees the teenage girl on the train platform, standing in the pouring rain, clutching an infant in her arms.

More than 200 million years ago, geological forces split apart the continents. Isolated from each other, the two halves of the world developed radically different suites of plants and animals. When Christopher Columbus set foot in the Americas, he ended that separation at a stroke. Driven by the economic goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new homes across the oceans. The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is the reason there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland, and chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures the colonists knew nothing about hitched along for the ride. Earthworms, mosquitoes, and cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions, and African grasses; bacteria, fungi, and viruses; rats of every description\u2014all of them rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like before, changing lives and landscapes across the planet. Eight decades after Columbus, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country in the world. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, silver from the Americas, mined by African and Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the first time that goods and people from every corner of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi and the Spanish empire he served created a new world economically.As Charles C. Mann shows, the Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent human history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico City\u2014where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interacted\u2014the center of the world. In such encounters, he uncovers the germ of today\u2019s fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.In 1493, Charles Mann gives us an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination\n", "genres": ["American History", "Science", "Nonfiction", "North American Hi...", "Anthropology", "Historical", "History", "Audiobook", "Economics", "World History", "Environment"]}, "146191": {"bookid": "146191", "title": "The Unsettling of America: Culture and Agriculture", "author": "Wendell Berry", "series": "", "ratings": "4506", "reviews": "419", "rating": "4.36", "description": "Since its publication by Sierra Club Books in 1977, The Unsettling of America has been recognized as a classic of American letters.

Running for his life, but not before he picks up a bloodstained letter opener that puts the president at the scene of the crime, the burglar becomes the target of a clandestine manhunt orchestrated by leading members of the executive branch.Meanwhile, Jack Graham, once a public defender and now a high-powered corporate attorney, gets drawn into the case because the on-the-lam burglar just happens to be the father of his former financee, a crusading Virginia prosecutor.

Animal lovers and sports fans were shocked when the story broke about NFL player Michael Vick's brutal dog fighting operation. But what became of the dozens of dogs who survived? As acclaimed writer Jim Gorant discovered, their story is the truly newsworthy aspect of this case. Expanding on Gorant's Sports Illustrated cover story, The Lost Dogs traces the effort to bring Vick to justice and turns the spotlight on these infamous pit bulls, which were saved from euthanasia by an outpouring of public appeals coupled with a court order that Vick pay nearly a million dollars in \"restitution\" to the dogs. As an ASPCA-led team evaluated each one, they found a few hardened fighters, but many more lovable, friendly creatures desperate for compassion. In The Lost Dogs, we meet these amazing animals, a number of which are now living in loving homes, while some even work in therapy programs: Johnny Justice participates in Paws for Tales, which lets kids get comfortable with reading aloud by reading to dogs; Leo spends three hours a week with cancer patients and troubled teens. At the heart of the stories are the rescue workers who transformed the pups from victims of animal cruelty into healing caregivers themselves, unleashing priceless hope.Includes an 8-page photo insert.Watch a video\n", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Dogs", "Crime", "Memoir", "Autobiography", "Audiobook", "Mystery", "Nature", "Biography", "Sociology", "Animals", "True Crime", "Environment"]}, "11201007": {"bookid": "11201007", "title": "Hearts in Darkness", "author": "Laura Kaye", "series": "(Hearts in Darkness #1)", "ratings": "36550", "reviews": "3081", "rating": "3.86", "description": "Makenna James thinks her day can't get any worse, until she finds herself stuck in a pitch-black elevator with a complete stranger.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated with an introduction by Betty Radice.A prominent lawyer and administrator, Pliny was also a prolific letter-writer, who numbered among his correspondents such eminent figures as Tacitus, Suetonius and the Emperor Trajan, as well as a wide circle of friends and family. His lively and very personal letters address an astonishing range of topics, from a deeply moving account of his uncle's death in the eruption that engulfed Pompeii, to observations on the early Christians - 'a desperate sort of cult carried to extravagant lengths' - from descriptions of everyday life in Rome, with its scandals and court cases, to Pliny's life in the country.Betty Radice's definitive edition was the forst complete modern translation of Pliny's letters. In her introduction she examines the shrewd, tolerant and occasionally pompous man who emerges from these letters.Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus (c. 61-113), better known as Pliny the Younger, and nephew of Pliny the Elder, was born in Como, Italy. Beginning his career at the bar when he was eighteen, Pliny managed to emerge unscathed from Domitian's 'reign of terror', even being appointed an official at the treasury. In 103 he was awarded a priesthood in recognition of his distinguished public service, and was prominent in several major prosecutions.

These remarkable stories demonstrate that gifts of time, skills, things, and ideas are as important and effective as contributions of money. From Bill and Melinda Gates to a six-year-old California girl named McKenzie Steiner, who organized and supervised drives to clean up the beach in her community, Clinton introduces us to both well-known and unknown heroes of giving. Among them:Dr. Paul Farmer, who grew up living in the family bus in a trailer park, vowed to devote his life to giving high-quality medical care to the poor and has built innovative public health-care clinics first in Haiti and then in Rwanda;a New York couple, in Africa for a wedding, who visited several schools in Zimbabwe and were appalled by the absence of textbooks and school supplies. They founded their own organization to gather and ship materials to thirty-five schools. After three years, the percentage of seventh-graders who pass reading tests increased from 5 percent to 60 percent;'Oseola McCarty, who after seventy-five years of eking out a living by washing and ironing, gave $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi to endow a scholarship fund for African-American students;Andre Agassi, who has created a college preparatory academy in the Las Vegas neighborhood with the city\u2019s highest percentage of at-risk kids. \u201cTennis was a stepping-stone for me,\u201d says Agassi. \u201cChanging a child\u2019s life is what I always wanted to do\u201d;Heifer International, which gave twelve goats to a Ugandan village. Within a year, Beatrice Biira\u2019s mother had earned enough money selling goat\u2019s milk to pay Beatrice\u2019s school fees and eventually to send all her children to school\u2014and, as required, to pass on a baby goat to another family, thus multiplying the impact of the gift.Clinton writes about men and women who traded in their corporate careers, and the fulfillment they now experience through giving. He writes about energy-efficient practices, about progressive companies going green, about promoting fair wages and decent working conditions around the world. He shows us how one of the most important ways of giving can be an effort to change, improve, or protect a government policy. He outlines what we as individuals can do, the steps we can take, how much we should consider giving, and why our giving is so important.Bill Clinton\u2019s own actions in his post-presidential years have had an enormous impact on the lives of millions. Through his foundation and his work in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, he has become an international spokesperson and model for the power of giving.\u201cWe all have the capacity to do great things,\u201d President Clinton says. \u201cMy hope is that the people and stories in this book will lift spirits, touch hearts, and demonstrate that citizen activism and service can be a powerful agent of change in the world.\u201d\n", "genres": ["Social Movements", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "Philosophy", "Leadership", "Education", "Audiobook", "Inspirational", "Biography", "Business", "Social Justice"]}, "25815": {"bookid": "25815", "title": "The Rings of Saturn", "author": "W.G.

Unwilling to be separated for the lengthy trip, Ginny insists that family accompany Harry, launching a year long journey to the United States and the American wizarding school of Alma Aleron.Determined to avoid adventure for the term, James finds himself unwittingly pulled into an international incident involving Petra Morganstern, who has accompanied the family to the states along with her younger Muggle step-sister Izabella. Apparently framed for a crime she didn't commit, James, Ralph and Zane must prove Petra's innocence before she is separated from Izzy forever.Complicating matters, however, is the very real possibility that, despite James' growing feelings for Petra, she may indeed be guilty of the crime she has been accused of, and perhaps even worse things. Because Petra, as James slowly learns, is no ordinary witch. Her magic is mysteriously powerful, even without a wand, and headmaster Merlin himself seems wary of her.In the end, James must choose to confront the truth that he has been seeking, knowing that it may well shatter his perception of the girl he loves, and even the stability of the magical world at large.\n", "genres": ["Adventure", "Witches", "Magic", "Fantasy", "Paranormal", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Childrens", "Fan Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Mystery"]}, "182425": {"bookid": "182425", "title": "False Memory", "author": "Dean Koontz", "series": "", "ratings": "45498", "reviews": "1355", "rating": "3.89", "description": "It's a fear more paralyzing than falling.

January 12, 1888, began as an unseasonably warm morning across Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, the weather so mild that children walked to school without coats and gloves. But that afternoon, without warning, the atmosphere suddenly, violently changed. One moment the air was calm; the next the sky exploded in a raging chaos of horizontal snow and hurricane-force winds. Temperatures plunged as an unprecedented cold front ripped through the center of the continent. By Friday morning, January 13, some five hundred people lay dead on the drifted prairie, many of them children who had perished on their way home from country schools. In a few terrifying hours, the hopes of the pioneers had been blasted by the bitter realities of their harsh environment. Recent immigrants from Germany, Norway, Denmark, and the Ukraine learned that their free homestead was not a paradise but a hard, unforgiving place governed by natural forces they neither understood nor controlled. With the storm as its dramatic, heartbreaking focal point, The Children's Blizzard captures this pivotal moment in American history by tracing the stories of five families who were forever changed that day. Drawing on family interviews and memoirs, as well as hundreds of contemporary accounts, David Laskin creates an intimate picture of the men, women, and children who made choices they would regret as long as they lived. Here too is a meticulous account of the evolution of the storm and the vain struggle of government forecasters to track its progress. The blizzard of January 12, 1888, is still remembered on the prairie. Children fled that day while their teachers screamed into the relentless roar. Husbands staggered into the blinding wind in search of wives. Fathers collapsed while trying to drag their children to safety. In telling the story of this meteorological catastrophe, the deadliest blizzard ever to hit the prairie states, David Laskin has produced a masterful portrait of a tragic crucible in the settlement of the American heartland.\n", "genres": ["Adult", "Adventure", "American History", "Nonfiction", "Science", "North American Hi...", "Literature", "Historical", "Survival", "History", "19th Century", "Audiobook", "Nature", "Environment"]}, "24937": {"bookid": "24937", "title": "Wicked: The Grimmerie", "author": "David Cote", "series": "", "ratings": "49454", "reviews": "285", "rating": "4.19", "description": "So much happened before Dorothy dropped in.

Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.\n", "genres": ["Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural", "Novels", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Race", "Historical Fiction", "African American"]}, "774964": {"bookid": "774964", "title": "If You Liked School, You'll Love Work", "author": "Irvine Welsh", "series": "", "ratings": "3763", "reviews": "209", "rating": "3.43", "description": "These five stories remind us that Welsh is a master of the shorter form, a brilliant storyteller and, unarguably, one of the funniest and filthiest writers alive.In Rattlesnakes, when three young Americans find themselves lost in the desert, how is it that one find himself performing fallatio on another while being watched by the bare-breasted Madeline and two armed Mexica\nThese five stories remind us that Welsh is a master of the shorter form, a brilliant storyteller and, unarguably, one of the funniest and filthiest writers alive.In Rattlesnakes, when three young Americans find themselves lost in the desert, how is it that one find himself performing fallatio on another while being watched by the bare-breasted Madeline and two armed Mexicans?Who is the mysterious Korean chef who has moved in with Chicago socialite Kendra Cross, in The D.O.G.S. of Lincoln Park, and what does he have to do with the disappearance of her faithful pooch, Toto?In the title story, can Mickey Baker, an English bar-owner on the Costa Brava, manage to keep all his balls in the air: maintaining his barmaid Teresa\u2019s body weight at the sexual maximum while attending to the youthful Persephone, and dodging his persistent ex-wife and a pair of Spanish gangsters?In Miss Arizona, Raymond Wilson Butler is writing a biography of a legendary U.S. movie director.

The last twenty years has seen a cottage industry of books on this divide, but with little consensus emerging. Plantinga, as a top philosopher but also a proponent of the rationality of religious belief, has a unique contribution to make. His theme in this short book is that the conflict between science and theistic religion is actually superficial, and that at a deeper level they are in concord.Plantinga examines where this conflict is supposed to exist -- evolution, evolutionary psychology, analysis of scripture, scientific study of religion -- as well as claims by Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Philip Kitcher that evolution and theistic belief cannot co-exist. Plantinga makes a case that their arguments are not only inconclusive but that the supposed conflicts themselves are superficial, due to the methodological naturalism used by science. On the other hand, science can actually offer support to theistic doctrines, and Plantinga uses the notion of biological and cosmological \"fine-tuning\" in support of this idea. Plantinga argues that we might think about arguments in science and religion in a new way -- as different forms of discourse that try to persuade people to look at questions from a perspective such that they can see that something is true. In this way, there is a deep and massive consonance between theism and the scientific enterprise.\n", "genres": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Faith", "Philosophy", "Christianity", "History", "Atheism", "Theology", "Christian", "Religion"]}, "496895": {"bookid": "496895", "title": "God, Freedom, and Evil", "author": "Alvin Plantinga", "series": "", "ratings": "863", "reviews": "95", "rating": "4.10", "description": "In his discussion of natural theology (arguments to prove the existence of God) and natural atheology (arguments for the falsehood of theistic belief) Plantinga focuses on two of the traditional arguments: the ontological argument as an example of natural theology, and the problem of evil as the most important representative of natural atheology.

Romance for him is art and beauty. But sex is sex. And he needs lots of it. He doesn\u2019t connect the two. He\u2019s never witnessed love in its finer form, for his youth was crippled by a difficult upbringing. But no one knows that. When he encounters Penelope Green at an art exhibition selling her work, he\u2019s not only spellbound by her beauty, but by her art which speaks to his soul. It\u2019s not just smoldering attraction that they share, but also difficult pasts. While her upbringing took place in a rundown estate caring for her troubled mother, Blake\u2019s, although brought up in a picturesque village, was just as dark. He grew up around the windswept moors in a gothic castle with walls stained in secrets, and where his mother worked as a maid. Leading her into a world of opulence, taste, and raw lust, Blake Sinclair with eyes that flit from moody to stormy blue, manages to seduce Penelope. Her entry into his bedroom, other than eliciting steamy passion, opens up a part of him hidden even from himself. He soon finds himself swimming in uncharted waters. Although he\u2019s not new to addiction, this time it\u2019s not just sex that\u2019s got Sinclair in its tantalizing grip, but something deeper and more powerful. Penelope\u2019s not only a hot temptress, but a kindred spirit, and even more profoundly, she knows what \u201cdark\u201d feels like. When he learns that she too has secrets, Penelope becomes his obsession. Even if his need for control is constantly challenged by her feisty independence: a quality that not only feeds his sudden unhealthy need to possess her but also places a wedge between them. Dylan Fox is a nefarious character that shadows this story. As the son of Lord William Fox, Blake\u2019s late mother\u2019s employer, Fox grew up terrorizing the young Blake. Believing that Blake stole from him, Dylan Fox, who runs a criminal empire, drags Blake into the center of a scandal involving the rich and powerful, a private island, and teenage girls. Blake Sinclair has one powerful weapon: a clear conscience. But he has to convince Penelope and the world around him first. Faced with criminal gangs, while working behind the scenes on a dangerous expos\u00e9 involving big names, Blake flexes his considerable muscles to save Penelope and his reputation.\n", "genres": ["Romance", "Fiction", "New Adult", "Epic", "Drama"]}, "8045080": {"bookid": "8045080", "title": "Hell's Corner", "author": "David Baldacci", "series": "(Camel Club #5)", "ratings": "35979", "reviews": "1983", "rating": "4.14", "description": "Oliver Stone and the Camel Club star in #1 bestselling author David Baldacci's most stunning adventure of the series.An attack on the heart of power . . .

In the chaotic aftermath, Stone takes on a new, more urgent assignment: find those responsible.British MI-6 agent Mary Chapman becomes Stone's partner in the search.

Author Michael Moorcock, already a major player in science fiction, cemented his position in the fantasy pantheon with the five-book Elric saga, of which Elric of Melnibon\u00e9 is the first installment. The book's namesake, the brooding albino emperor of the dying nation of Melnibon\u00e9, is a sort of Superman for Goths, truly an archetype of the genre.The youthful Elric is a cynical and melancholy king, heir to a nation whose 100,000-year rule of the world ended less than 500 years hence. More interested in brooding contemplation than holding the throne, Elric is a reluctant ruler, but he also realizes that no other worthy successor exists and the survival of his once-powerful, decadent nation depends on him alone. Elric's nefarious, brutish cousin Yrkoon has no patience for his physically weak kinsman, and he plots constantly to seize Elric's throne, usually over his dead body. Elric of Melnibon\u00e9 follows Yrkoon's scheming, reaching its climax in a battle between Elric and Yrkoon with the demonic runeblades Stormbringer and Mournblade.
