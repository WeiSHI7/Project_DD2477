But nowhere is this drive to do better more important than in medicine, where lives are on the line with every decision. In his new book, Atul Gawande explores how doctors strive to close the gap between best intentions and best performance in the face of obstacles that sometimes seem insurmountable. Gawande's gripping stories of diligence, ingenuity, and what it means to do right by people take us to battlefield surgical tents in Iraq, to labor and delivery rooms in Boston, to a polio outbreak in India, and to malpractice courtrooms around the country. He discusses the ethical dilemmas of doctors participation in lethal injections, examines the influence of money on modern medicine, and recounts the astoundingly contentious history of hand washing. And as in all his writing, Gawande gives us an inside look at his own life as a practicing surgeon, offering a searingly honest firsthand account of work in a field where mistakes are both unavoidable and unthinkable. At once unflinching and compassionate, Better is an exhilarating journey narrated by arguably the best nonfiction doctor-writer around (Salon). Gawande's investigation into medical professionals and how they progress from merely good to great provides rare insight into the elements of success, illuminating every area of human endeavor.\n", "genres": ["Autobiography", "Memoir", "Health Care", "Science", "Medical", "Writing", "Health", "Business", "Audiobook", "Essays", "Nonfiction", "Medicine"]}, "12751687": {"bookid": "12751687", "title": "Finale", "author": "Becca Fitzpatrick", "series": "(Hush, Hush #4)", "ratings": "160119", "reviews": "8923", "rating": "4.14", "description": "Nora and Patch thought their troubles were behind them.

It is through her father, the renowned artist Oscar Sparrow, that Lina discovers Josephine Bell and a controversy roiling the art world: are the iconic paintings long ascribed to Lu Anne Bell really the work of her house slave, Josephine? A descendant of Josephine's would be the perfect face for the reparations lawsuit - if Lina can find one.

Baumeister, teams with New York Times science writer John Tierney to reveal the secrets of self-control and how to master it. In Willpower, the pioneering researcher Roy F. Baumeister collaborates with renowned New York Times science writer John Tierney to revolutionize our understanding of the most coveted human virtue: self-control.In what became one of the most cited papers in social science literature, Baumeister discovered that willpower actually operates like a muscle: it can be strengthened with practice and fatigued by overuse. Willpower is fueled by glucose, and it can be bolstered simply by replenishing the brain's store of fuel. That's why eating and sleeping- and especially failing to do either of those-have such dramatic effects on self-control (and why dieters have such a hard time resisting temptation).Baumeister's latest research shows that we typically spend four hours every day resisting temptation. No wonder people around the world rank a lack of self-control as their biggest weakness. Willpower looks to the lives of entrepreneurs, parents, entertainers, and artists-including David Blaine, Eric Clapton, and others-who have flourished by improving their self-control.The lessons from their stories and psychologists' experiments can help anyone. You learn not only how to build willpower but also how to conserve it for crucial moments by setting the right goals and using the best new techniques for monitoring your progress. Once you master these techniques and establish the right habits, willpower gets easier: you'll need less conscious mental energy to avoid temptation. That's neither magic nor empty self-help sloganeering, but rather a solid path to a better life.Combining the best of modern social science with practical wisdom, Baumeister and Tierney here share the definitive compendium of modern lessons in willpower. As our society has moved away from the virtues of thrift and self-denial, it often feels helpless because we face more temptations than ever. But we also have more knowledge and better tools for taking control of our lives. However we define happiness-a close- knit family, a satisfying career, financial security-we won't reach it without mastering self-control.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Self Help", "Philosophy", "Science", "Personal Development", "Productivity", "Health", "Audiobook", "Business", "Nonfiction"]}, "290037": {"bookid": "290037", "title": "The Book of Revelation", "author": "Rupert Thomson", "series": "", "ratings": "1189", "reviews": "92", "rating": "3.53", "description": "In an edgy psychological thriller that is as mesmerizing as it is profound, Rupert Thomson fearlessly delves into the darkest realm of the human spirit to reveal the sinister connection between sexuality and power.Stepping out of his Amsterdam studio one April afternoon to buy cigarettes for his girlfriend, a dashing 29-year old Englishman reflects on their wonderful seven\nIn an edgy psychological thriller that is as mesmerizing as it is profound, Rupert Thomson fearlessly delves into the darkest realm of the human spirit to reveal the sinister connection between sexuality and power.Stepping out of his Amsterdam studio one April afternoon to buy cigarettes for his girlfriend, a dashing 29-year old Englishman reflects on their wonderful seven-year relationship, and his stellar career as an internationally acclaimed dancer and choreographer.

As Bethany approaches her thirteenth birthday, her parents act more oddly than usual. Her mother cries constantly, and her father barely lets Bethany out of his sight. Then one morning he hustles the entire family into the car, drives across several state lines -- and leaves Bethany with an aunt she never knew existed. Bethany has no idea what's going on. She's worried her mom and dad are running from some kind of trouble, but she can't find out because they won't tell her where they are going.   Bethany's only clue is a few words she overheard her father tell her aunt: \"She doesn't know anything about Elizabeth.\" But Aunt Myrlie won't tell Bethany who Elizabeth is, and she won't explain why people in her small town react to Bethany as if they've seen a ghost. The mystery intensifies when Bethany gets a package from her father containing four different birth certificates from four different states, with four different last names -- and thousands of dollars in cash. And when a strange man shows up asking questions, Bethany realizes the's not the only one who's desperate to unravel the secrets of her past.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Science Fiction", "Middle Grade", "Realistic Fiction", "Childrens", "Fantasy", "Teen", "Suspense", "Young Adult"]}, "889418": {"bookid": "889418", "title": "The Star Diaries: Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy", "author": "Stanis\u0142aw Lem", "series": "(Ijon Tichy #1)", "ratings": "7616", "reviews": "371", "rating": "4.26", "description": "\u201cLem muazzam bir hayal g\u00fcc\u00fc zenginli\u011fine ve karakter yaratma h\u00fcnerine sahip. \u00c7ok komik, alayc\u0131, \u015fa\u015f\u0131rt\u0131c\u0131 ve bilgili bir yazar.\u201d\u2014 Theodore SturgeonZaman atlamalar\u0131nda s\u00fcrekli kendine rastlayan bir gezgin, robotlar\u0131n d\u00fcnyas\u0131n\u0131 g\u00f6zetlemeye giden bir casus, uzayda birbirinden garip canl\u0131larla ve uygarl\u0131klarla kar\u015f\u0131la\u015fan bir k\u00e2\u015fif ve bir s\u00fcpernova orman\u0131nda umutsuzca kaybolup \n\u201cLem muazzam bir hayal g\u00fcc\u00fc zenginli\u011fine ve karakter yaratma h\u00fcnerine sahip. \u00c7ok komik, alayc\u0131, \u015fa\u015f\u0131rt\u0131c\u0131 ve bilgili bir yazar.\u201d\u2014 Theodore SturgeonZaman atlamalar\u0131nda s\u00fcrekli kendine rastlayan bir gezgin, robotlar\u0131n d\u00fcnyas\u0131n\u0131 g\u00f6zetlemeye giden bir casus, uzayda birbirinden garip canl\u0131larla ve uygarl\u0131klarla kar\u015f\u0131la\u015fan bir k\u00e2\u015fif ve bir s\u00fcpernova orman\u0131nda umutsuzca kaybolup \u00e7\u0131k\u0131\u015f\u0131 arayan bir yolcu.

Communities where heroin had never been seen before\u2014from Charlotte, NC and Huntington, WVA, to Salt Lake City and Portland, OR\u2014were overrun with it. Local police and residents were stunned. How could heroin, long considered a drug found only in the dense, urban environments along the East Coast, and trafficked into the United States by enormous Colombian drug cartels, be so incredibly ubiquitous in the American heartland? Who was bringing it here, and perhaps more importantly, why were so many townspeople suddenly eager for the comparatively cheap high it offered?With the same dramatic drive of El Narco and Methland, Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of American capitalism: The stories of young men in Mexico, independent of the drug cartels, in search of their own American Dream via the fast and enormous profits of trafficking cheap black-tar heroin to America\u2019s rural and suburban addicts; and that of Purdue Pharma in Stamford, Connecticut, determined to corner the market on pain with its new and expensive miracle drug, Oxycontin; extremely addictive in its own right. Quinones illuminates just how these two stories fit together as cause and effect: hooked on costly Oxycontin, American addicts were lured to much cheaper black tar heroin and its powerful and dangerous long-lasting high. Embroiled alongside the suppliers and buyers are DEA agents, local, small-town sheriffs, and the US attorney from eastern Virginia whose case against Purdue Pharma and Oxycontin made him an enemy of the Bush-era Justice Department, ultimately stalling and destroying his career in public service.Dreamland is a scathing and incendiary account of drug culture and addiction spreading to every part of the American landscape.\n", "genres": ["Mystery", "Politics", "True Crime", "Medical", "Sociology", "Crime", "Health", "History", "Audiobook", "Nonfiction", "Medicine"]}, "64217": {"bookid": "64217", "title": "Pyramids", "author": "Terry Pratchett", "series": "(Discworld #7)", "ratings": "77910", "reviews": "2268", "rating": "3.91", "description": "It's bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn't a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.

Descending from a single goddess \u2013 the only one to survive the ancient cataclysm that wiped out the gods and most of their immortal offspring \u2013 clan members are forbidden to each other. And as the only other known immortals are their hated enemies, Kian and his kin have been long resigned to a lonely existence of fleeting trysts with human partners. That is, until Kian's sister Amanda \u2013 a researcher of paranormal abilities \u2013 makes a game changing discovery; a mortal seeress who she believes is a dormant carrier of their genes. Ever the realist, Kian is skeptical and refuses his sister's plea to attempt the Dormant's activation. But when his enemies learn of\u00a0the highly coveted soothsayer's existence and attempt to grab her, he rushes her to the safety of his keep. Inexorably drawn to Syssi's shy beauty, Kian is startled by feelings he had sworn off long ago. Tormented by past mistakes, he wrestles with his conscience as he is tempted to explore\u00a0her budding interest in the spicy passions he favors.When Syssi's paranormal foresight lands her a job at Dr. Amanda Dokani's neuroscience lab, it fails to predict, not only that her boss is an immortal who would drag her into a secret, millennia-old battle over humanity's future, but the professor's imposing brother who would alter her own. Despite his better judgement, will Kian succumb to Syssi's irresistible pull? And will Syssi discover that the man igniting her startlingly dark desires is a nearly two-thousand-year-old immortal?Warning. This book contains hot scenes and adult themes.

A group of terrorists has descended on the Executive Mansion, and gained access by means of a violent massacre that has left dozens of innocent bystanders murdered.

While the politicians and the military leaders argue over how to negotiate with the terrorists, one man is sent in to break through the barrage of panicked responses and political agendas surrounding the chaotic crisis. Mitch Rapp, the CIA's top counterterrorism operative, makes his way into the White House and soon discovers that the president is not as safe as Washington's power elite had thought. Moving stealthily among the corridors and secret passageways of the White House, stepping terrifyingly close to the enemy, Rapp scrambles to save the hostages before the terrorists can extract the president from the safety of his bunker. In a race against time, Rapp makes a chilling discovery that could rock Washington to its core: someone within his own government is maneuvering in hopes that his rescue attempt will fail.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Mystery Thriller", "Audiobook", "Action", "Crime", "Espionage", "Suspense", "Spy Thriller", "Thriller"]}, "311150": {"bookid": "311150", "title": "Arabella", "author": "Georgette Heyer", "series": "", "ratings": "18060", "reviews": "1603", "rating": "4.08", "description": "To Arabella Tallant, the eldest daughter of a penniless country clergyman, the invitation to stay with her London godmother was like the key to heaven, for in addition to living in the glamorous city, Arabella might even find a suitable husband there.

Armed with beauty, virtue and a benevolent godmother, the impetuous but impoverished Arabella embarked on her first London season with her mother's wish in mind: snare a rich husband. On her way to London Arabella's carriage breaks down outside the hunting lodge of the wealthy and socially prominent Robert Beaumaris, fate cast her in his path. Arabella's only fault is impetuosity, and her pride stung when she overhears a remark of her path of arrogant host, who accused her of being another petty female after his wealth, the proud, headstrong ingenue made a most startling claim -- she was an heiress! A pretense that deeply amuses the jaded Beau. To counter her white lie, Beaumaris launches her into high society and thereby subjects her to all kinds of amorous fortune hunters in London and other embarrassments.Suddenly Arabella found herself the talk of the ton and pursued by some of the most eligible young men of the day. But only one caught Arabella's fancy: Beaumaris, the handsome and dedicated bachelor. She should know better than to allow herself to be provoked by nonpareil Beau. But would her deceitful charade destroy her one chance for true love...?Beaumaris, however, although a most artful matrimonial dodger, badly underestimated his seemingly naive adversary... When compassionate Arabella rescues such unfortunate creatures as a mistreated chimney sweep and a mixed-breed mongrel, she foists them upon Beaumaris, who finds he rather enjoys the role of rescuer and is soon given the opportunity to prove his worth in the person of Bertram Tallant, the also impetuous young brother of Arabella....\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "British Literature", "Historical Romance", "Historical Fiction", "European Literature", "Romance", "Classics", "Historical", "Regency", "Audiobook", "Regency Romance"]}, "28920": {"bookid": "28920", "title": "A Pale View of Hills", "author": "Kazuo Ishiguro", "series": "", "ratings": "25422", "reviews": "2630", "rating": "3.78", "description": "Librarian note: This a previously-published edition of ISBN 9780571225378.In his highly acclaimed debut, A Pale View of Hills, Kazuo Ishiguro tells the story of Etsuko, a Japanese woman now living alone in England, dwelling on the recent suicide of her daughter.

Serano shares her experiences and observations\u2014both pre- and post-transition\u2014to reveal the ways in which fear, suspicion, and dismissiveness toward femininity shape our societal attitudes toward trans women, as well as gender and sexuality as a whole.Serano's well-honed arguments stem from her ability to bridge the gap between the often-disparate biological and social perspectives on gender. She exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this \u201cfeminine\u201d weakness exists only to attract and appease male desire.In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activist must work to embrace and empower femininity\u2014in all of its wondrous forms.\n", "genres": ["Autobiography", "LGBT", "Politics", "Social Justice", "Memoir", "Social Movements", "Transgender", "Queer", "Gender", "Gender Studies", "Feminism", "Nonfiction"]}, "458347": {"bookid": "458347", "title": "The Short Stories", "author": "Ernest Hemingway", "series": "", "ratings": "7727", "reviews": "253", "rating": "4.26", "description": "At the age of twenty-two, Ernest Hemingway wrote his first short story, \"Up in Michigan.\" Seventeen years and forty-eight titles later, he was the undisputed master of the short-story form and the leading American man of letters.

It is, rather, the total presence of fear, with the courage to face it.

Instead of trying to hang on to the familiar and the known, we can learn to enjoy these situations as opportunities for adventure and for deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.The book begins with an in-depth exploration of the meaning of courage and how it is expressed in the everyday life of the individual. Unlike books that focus on heroic acts of courage in exceptional circumstances, the focus here is on developing the inner courage that enables us to lead authentic and fulfilling lives on a day-to-day basis. This is the courage to change when change is needed, the courage to stand up for our own truth, even against the opinions of others, and the courage to embrace the unknown in spite of our fears-in our relationships, in our careers, or in the ongoing journey of understanding who we are and why we are here.Courage also features a number of meditation techniques specifically designed by Osho to help people deal with their fears.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Religion", "Self Help", "Spirituality", "Philosophy", "Personal Development", "Inspirational", "Unfinished", "Nonfiction", "New Age"]}, "124092": {"bookid": "124092", "title": "Me and My Big Mouth!: Your Answer Is Right Under Your Nose", "author": "Joyce Meyer", "series": "", "ratings": "5015", "reviews": "118", "rating": "4.38", "description": "Is your mouth busy telling about all the troubles in your life?

But, in this flood of publishing and republishing, very little ever gets said about what exactly Chomsky stands for, his own personal politics, his vision of the future.Not, that is, until Chomsky on Anarchism, a groundbreaking new book that shows a different side of this best-selling author: the anarchist principles that have guided him since he was a teenager. This collection of Chomsky\u2019s essays and inter-views includes numerous pieces that have never been published before, as well as rare material that first saw the light of day in hard-to-find pamphlets and anarchist periodicals. Taken together, they paint a fresh picture of Chomsky, showing his lifelong involvement with the anarchist community, his constant commitment to nonhierarchical models of political organization and his hopes for a future world without rulers.For anyone who\u2019s been touched by Chomsky\u2019s trenchant analysis of our current situation, as well as anyone looking for an intelligent and coherent discussion of anarchism itself, look no further than Chomsky on Anarchism.Noam Chomsky is one of the world\u2019s leading intellectuals, the father of modern linguistics, an outspoken media and foreign policy critic and tireless activist.

But wealth and position could not shield Adeline from a childhood of appalling emotional abuse at the hands of a cruel and manipulative Eurasian stepmother. Determined to survive through her enduring faith in family unity, Adeline struggled for independence as she moved from Hong Kong to England and eventually to the United States to become a physician and writer.A compelling, painful, and ultimately triumphant story of a girl's journey into adulthood, Adeline's story is a testament to the most basic of human needs: acceptance, love, and understanding. With a powerful voice that speaks of the harsh realities of growing up female in a family and society that kept girls in emotional chains, Falling Leaves is a work of heartfelt intimacy and a rare authentic portrait of twentieth-century China.\n", "genres": ["Autobiography", "Asia", "Literature", "Asian Literature", "Historical", "Nonfiction", "Cultural", "History", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "Biography", "China"]}, "37662654": {"bookid": "37662654", "title": "The Strange One", "author": "Bernie Morris", "series": "", "ratings": "11", "reviews": "1", "rating": "4.64", "description": "It could have been like this - we don't really know.

Levin now delivers the book that characterizes both his devotion to his more than 5 million listeners and his love of our country and the legacy of our Founding Fathers: Liberty and Tyranny is Mark R. Levin's clarion call to conservative America, a new manifesto for the conservative movement for the 21st century.In the face of the modern liberal assault on Constitution-based values, an attack that has steadily snowballed since President Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and resulted in a federal government that is a massive, unaccountable conglomerate, the time for re-enforcing the intellectual and practical case for conservatism is now. Conservative beliefs in individual freedoms do in the end stand for liberty for all Americans, while liberal dictates lead to the breakdown of civilized society -- in short, tyranny. Looking back to look to the future, Levin writes \"conservatism is the antidote to tyranny precisely because its principles are our founding principles.\" And in a series of powerful essays, Levin lays out how conservatives can counter the liberal corrosion that has filtered into every timely issue affecting our daily lives, from the economy to health care, global warming, immigration, and more -- and illustrates how change, as seen through the conservative lens, is always prudent, and always an enhancement to individual freedom.As provocative, well-reasoned, robust, and informed as his on-air commentary, Levin's narrative will galvanize readers to begin a new era in conservative thinking and action. Liberty and Tyranny provides a philosophical, historical, and practical framework for revitalizing the conservative vision and ensuring the preservation of American society.\n", "genres": ["American", "Literature", "Politics", "Political Science", "Economics", "Philosophy", "Government", "American History", "History", "North American Hi...", "Audiobook", "Nonfiction"]}, "1848444": {"bookid": "1848444", "title": "A Scandal in Bohemia (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, #1)", "author": "Ronald  Holt", "series": "", "ratings": "83394", "reviews": "815", "rating": "4.23", "description": "This is an adaptation, containing 6 stories; for the original story, see A Scandal in BohemiaA Scandal in Bohemia is collection of six short stories featuring the great detective Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr Watson.

In Sculpting in Time, he has left his artistic testament, a remarkable revelation of both his life and work. Since Ivan's Childhood won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1962, the visionary quality and totally original and haunting imagery of Tarkovsky's films have captivated serious movie audiences all over the world, who see in his work a continuation of the great literary traditions of nineteenth-century Russia. Many critics have tried to interpret his intensely personal vision, but he himself always remained inaccessible.In Sculpting in Time, Tarkovsky sets down his thoughts and his memories, revealing for the first time the original inspirations for his extraordinary films--Ivan's Childhood, Andrey Rublyov, Solaris, The Mirror, Stalker, Nostalgia, and The Sacrifice. He discusses their history and his methods of work, he explores the many problems of visual creativity, and he sets forth the deeply autobiographical content of part of his oeuvre--most fascinatingly in The Mirror and Nostalgia.

Born William Sidney Porter, O. Henry started writing while in prison for embezzlement. Later he moved to New York, and his tales romanticizing the commonplace, particularly the life of ordinary New Yorkers, became highly popular. The most widely read author of his time, O.

His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone. Banker to the Poor is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in \"putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long.\" The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is necessary and inspirational reading for anyone interested in economics, public policy, philanthropy, social history, and business.  Muhammad Yunus was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement. He still lives in Bangladesh, and travels widely around the world on behalf of Grameen Bank and the concept of micro-credit.\n", "genres": ["Autobiography", "International Rel...", "Poverty", "Politics", "Social Justice", "Memoir", "Finance", "International Development", "Social Movements", "Social Issues", "Nonfiction", "Business", "Economics", "Biography"]}, "469933": {"bookid": "469933", "title": "Hondo", "author": "Louis L'Amour", "series": "(Frontera  #6)", "ratings": "10819", "reviews": "660", "rating": "4.04", "description": "He was etched by the desert\u2019s howling winds, a big, broad-shouldered man who knew the ways of the Apache and the ways of staying alive.

Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the \u201cKingdom of God.\u201d The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured, tortured, and executed as a state criminal. Within decades after his shameful death, his followers would call him God. Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history\u2019s most influential and enigmatic characters by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived: first-century Palestine, an age awash in apocalyptic fervor. Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotry\u2014a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious \u201cKing of the Jews\u201d whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity. Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazareth\u2019s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion.\n", "genres": ["Religion", "Christianity", "Theology", "Spirituality", "Philosophy", "Historical", "History", "Audiobook", "Nonfiction", "Biography"]}, "52263": {"bookid": "52263", "title": "SCUM Manifesto", "author": "Valerie Solanas", "series": "", "ratings": "6737", "reviews": "912", "rating": "3.68", "description": "SCUM Manifesto was considered one of the most outrageous, violent and certifiably crazy tracts when it first appeared in 1968.

It captures the moving reunion of two young men and their pet lion Christian, after they had left him in Africa with Born Free\u2019s George Adamson to introduce him into his rightful home in the wild.A Lion Called Christian tells the remarkable story of how Anthony \u201cAce\u201d Bourke and John Rendall, visitors to London from Australia in 1969, bought the boisterous lion cub in the pet department of Harrods. For several months, the three of them shared a flat above a furniture shop on London\u2019s King\u2019s Road, where the charismatic and intelligent Christian quickly became a local celebrity, cruising the streets in the back of a Bentley, popping in for lunch at a local restaurant, even posing for a fashion advertisement. But the lion cub was growing up\u2014fast\u2014and soon even the walled church garden where he went for exercise wasn\u2019t large enough for him. How could Ace and John avoid having to send Christian to a zoo for the rest of his life? A coincidental meeting with English actors Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, stars of the hit film Born Free, led to Christian being flown to Kenya and placed under the expert care of \u201cthe father of lions\u201d George Adamson. Incredibly, when Ace and John returned to Kenya to see Christian a year later, they received a loving welcome from their lion, who was by then fully integrated into Africa and a life with other lions. Originally published in 1971, and now fully revised and updated with more than 50 photographs of Christian from cuddly cub in London to magnificent lion in Africa, A Lion Called Christian is a touching and uplifting true story of an indelible human-animal bond. It is is destined to become one of the great classics of animal literature.\n", "genres": ["Autobiography", "Environment", "Audiobook", "Nature", "Animals", "Cats", "Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Biography Memoir", "Africa", "Memoir", "Biography"]}, "4711854": {"bookid": "4711854", "title": "The Machine Stops", "author": "E.M.

It was also a land withered by drought and hunger, and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy, and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala\u2014crazy\u2014but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do.Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy, William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002, his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education, William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died.Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach, a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks, and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessity\u2014electricity and running water. Using scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves, William forged a crude yet operable windmill, an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights, complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire.

It is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this superb book, Tom Brokaw goes out into America, to tell through the stories of individual men and women the story of a generation, America's citizen heroes and heroines who came of age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went on to build modern America. This generation was united not only by a common purpose, but also by common values--duty, honor, economy, courage, service, love of family and country, and, above all, responsibility for oneself. In this book, you will meet people whose everyday lives reveal how a generation persevered through war, and were trained by it, and then went on to create interesting and useful lives and the America we have today.\"At a time in their lives when their days and nights should have been filled with innocent adventure, love, and the lessons of the workaday world, they were fighting in the most primitive conditions possible across the bloodied landscape of France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, and the coral islands of the Pacific. They answered the call to save the world from the two most powerful and ruthless military machines ever assembled, instruments of conquest in the hands of fascist maniacs. They faced great odds and a late start, but they did not protest. They succeeded on every front. They won the war; they saved the world. They came home to joyous and short-lived celebrations and immediately began the task of rebuilding their lives and the world they wanted. They married in record numbers and gave birth to another distinctive generation, the Baby Boomers. A grateful nation made it possible for more of them to attend college than any society had ever educated, anywhere. They gave the world new science, literature, art, industry, and economic strength unparalleled in the long curve of history. As they now reach the twilight of their adventurous and productive lives, they remain, for the most part, exceptionally modest. They have so many stories to tell, stories that in many cases they have never told before, because in a deep sense they didn't think that what they were doing was that special, because everyone else was doing it too. \"This book, I hope, will in some small way pay tribute to those men and women who have given us the lives we have today--an American family portrait album of the greatest generation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this book you'll meet people like Charles Van Gorder, who set up during D-Day a MASH-like medical facility in the middle of the fighting, and then came home to create a clinic and hospital in his hometown. You'll hear George Bush talk about how, as a Navy Air Corps combat pilot, one of his assignments was to read the mail of the enlisted men under him, to be sure no sensitive military information would be compromised. And so, Bush says, \"I learned about life.\" You'll meet Trudy Elion, winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine, one of the many women in this book who found fulfilling careers in the changed society as a result of the war.

The book's central crime is a murder, which takes place before the novel opens. Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a Spacer Ambassador, lives in Spacetown, the Spacer outpost just outside New York City. For some time, he has tried to convince the Earth government to loosen its anti-robot restrictions. One morning, he is discovered outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer. Elijah must work with a Spacer partner, a highly advanced robot who is visually identical to a human, named R. Daneel Olivaw, even though Elijah, like many Earth residents, has a low opinion of robots. Together, they search for the murderer and try to avert an interstellar diplomatic incident.  Like its famous predecessor, The Nakes Sun is a whodunit story, in addition to being science fiction. The story arises from the murder of Rikaine Delmarre, a prominent scientist of Solaria, a planet politically hostile to Earth. Elijah Baley is called in to investigate, at the request of the Solarian government. He is again partnered with the humaniform robot R. Daneel Olivaw.   The Robots of Dawn is the third novel in Asimov's Robot series. Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw team up to solve the roboticide of a robot identical to Olivaw on the Spacer world of Aurora. The robot's inventor, Han Fastolfe, has been implicated. Fastolfe, who was last seen in The Caves of Steel, is the best roboticist on Aurora. He has admitted that he is the only person with the skill to have done it, although he denies doing it. Fastolfe is also a prominent member of the Auroran political faction that favors Earth. Implication in the crime threatens his political career; therefore, it is politically expedient that he be exonerated.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Science Fiction", "Speculative Fiction", "Space Opera", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Detective", "Classics", "Anthologies", "Robots", "Collections", "Space"]}, "743357": {"bookid": "743357", "title": "Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media: The Companion Book to the Award-Winning Film", "author": "Mark Achbar", "series": "", "ratings": "471", "reviews": "21", "rating": "4.37", "description": "Manufacturing Consent Noam Chomsky and the Media, the companion book to the award-winning film, charts the life of America's most famous dissident, from his boyhood days running his uncle's newsstand in Manhattan to his current role as outspoken social critic.A complete transcript of the film is complemented by key excerpts from the writings, interviews and correspondence.\nManufacturing Consent Noam Chomsky and the Media, the companion book to the award-winning film, charts the life of America's most famous dissident, from his boyhood days running his uncle's newsstand in Manhattan to his current role as outspoken social critic.A complete transcript of the film is complemented by key excerpts from the writings, interviews and correspondence.

But nothing prepares him for the day armed men, silent as thieves, swarm the villa courtyard ready to kill, to capture, to kidnap. Sophos, the heir to the throne of Sounis, disappears without a trace. In Attolia, Eugenides, the new and unlikely king, has never stopped wondering what happened to Sophos. Nor has the Queen of Eddis. They send spies. They pay informants. They appeal to the gods. But as time goes by, it becomes less and less certain that they will ever see their friend alive again. Across the small peninsula battles are fought, bribes are offered, and conspiracies are set in motion. Darkening the horizon, the Mede Empire threatens, always, from across the sea. And Sophos, anonymous and alone, bides his time. Sophos, drawing on his memories of Gen, Pol, the Magus and Eddis, sets out on an adventure that will change all of their lives forever.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "High Fantasy", "Mythology", "Historical Fiction", "Adventure", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Historical", "Young Adult Fantasy", "Audiobook", "Young Adult"]}, "475339": {"bookid": "475339", "title": "Madeline", "author": "Ludwig Bemelmans", "series": "(Madeline)", "ratings": "204072", "reviews": "2155", "rating": "4.24", "description": "Madeline is one of the best-loved characters in children's literature.

On its first publication in 1972 it sparked an international debate and became a rallying-point for feminism, changing the terminology of anthropologists forever. Starting with her demolition of the Biblical myth that woman was an afterthought to the creation of man, Elaine Morgan rewrites human history and evolution.This lively, informative book sets out to solve the riddle of our origins; its answer is controversial. Elaine Morgan has made The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis a plausible alternative to conventional theories of evolution and The Descent of Woman first set out an understanding of who humans are and where they came from.Elaine Morgan was best known as a writer for television until the publication of The Descent of Woman in 1972, which became an international bestseller. She then spent ten years researching human evolution before publishing The Aquatic Ape (published by Souvenir Press as a revised edition, The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis) in 1982. In the years since, The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis has gone on to win widespread support among scientists.It is a measure of Elaine Morgan's enduring importance, provocative thought and international reputation that in January 2006, the first Chinese translation of The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis became a Number 1 bestseller in Taiwan.\n", "genres": ["Anthropology", "Evolution", "Science", "Gender", "Gender Studies", "Feminism", "History", "Biology", "Nonfiction", "Womens"]}, "38747": {"bookid": "38747", "title": "Roughing It", "author": "Mark Twain", "series": "", "ratings": "8627", "reviews": "824", "rating": "3.89", "description": "Roughing It is a book of semi-autobiographical travel literature written by American humorist Mark Twain.

As strange as it may seem at first, drugs are not what we have been told they are; addiction is not what we think it is; and the drug war has very different motives to the ones we have seen on our TV screens.In Chasing the Scream, Hari reveals his startling discoveries entirely through the true and shocking stories of people across the world whose lives have been transformed by this war. They range from a transsexual crack dealer in Brooklyn searching for her mother, to a teenage hit-man in Mexico searching for a way out. It begins with Hari's discovery that at the birth of the drug war, Billie Holiday was stalked and killed by the man who launched this crusade \u2013 while it ends with the story of a brave doctor who has led his country to decriminalize every drug, from cannabis to crack, with remarkable results.Chasing the Scream lays bare what we really have been chasing in our century of drug war \u2013 in our hunger for drugs, and in our attempt to destroy them.

I also talk about home games against Stoke, Chelsea and Man U for instanceMy diatribes in my blogs and newspaper columns are simply my way of spinning the balls, because sometimes I like to see what number they land on. That\u2019s all.But although I\u2019m known mostly as a raconteur - and most of my books can be described as coming from the humourist vein \u2013 in \u2018Gunpowder Soup\u2019 I also touch on some subjects that are surely going to upset a few people.I\u2019ve never quite understood the politically correct brigade. Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he\u2019s laughing. No longer simply a fad, blogging is now an important new literary innovation. This book is not a story, and if you\u2019re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It\u2019s not for you. I won\u2019t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I\u2019m not being controversial enough \u2013 and trust me when I say that in this book I get controversial.Right now the planet is spinning in new and scary directions, and this needs to be addressed. So inside the covers of this book I take a look at some of the challenges we\u2019re currently facing. And some of my opinions are going to rattle a few people.So why the title \u2018Gunpowder Soup\u2019? Well, although my last book was entitled \u2018100 Common Sense Policies to make BRITAIN GREAT again\u2019 the book before that, \u2018Nobody Asked Me, But \u2026\u2019, showed a rabbit popping out of a tin of soup on the cover. \u2018Rabbit & Pork,\u2019 of course, is Cockney rhyming slang for Talk, and on more than one occasion I\u2019ve been accused of rabbiting away excessively \u2013 mostly at parties, and generally by my wife. So why a tin of soup? And why in particular Gunpowder Soup? Well I tend to believe that everyone is born perfect. Nobody is born with an inherent capacity to hate. It has to be taught. All of our experiences \u2013 family, school, work, the books we read, the newspapers we peruse, the music we listen to, our friends, our social life, the opinions of those around us, religion, sports we play or watch, those we love and those who love us, those we desire and those who desire us, those we travel with, our hopes and dreams and ambitions and achievements, our triumphs and disasters - go into a metaphorical cooking pot that we carry with us throughout our lives. All these \u2018ingredients\u2019 make up our Soup of Life.Now, when making a soup, once you\u2019ve added an ingredient, it\u2019s forever blended in and you can\u2019t take it out again. You add a sprinkling of finely chopped garnish; cumin or oregano, and you can never take that ingredient out again. Never, ever, ever.So say at the age of six you add black pepper or rosemary or hatred or love or comedy, from then onwards it\u2019ll always be part and parcel of your \u2018soup.\u2019 And as you add more ingredients the \u2018recipe\u2019 of your life evolves, and before you know it you can\u2019t taste the coriander or the love any more, but it\u2019s still there at a deep subliminal level. Remember that.Some people may not add hatred until they\u2019re in their twenties, and most of us never add it at all. And you can never entirely erase the flavour of a particular spice in soup. That\u2019s the metaphorical significance of a tin of soup, but since writing \u2018Nobody\u2019 it\u2019s becoming abundantly clear that we\u2019re facing greater challenges, and if we\u2019re not very, very careful the country as we know it - these \u2018pleasant pastures green\u2019 - are set to implode! What else can I say? I write like a finger up your bum. I\u2019m either a pleasant surprise or I make everything awkward and uncomfortable.

Key questions and an amazingly clear \"map\" are now at your fingertips to begin your journey to \"Live by Design.\" These are questions that, with the help of this book, you can answer and bring into action-oriented focus:What are the ten most defining moments of your life?What are the seven most critical choices you have made to put you on your current path?Who are the five most pivotal people in your world and how have they shaped you? Identifying and working with these key elements are at the heart of Dr. Phillip C. McGraw's latest work, Self Matters, and soon they will be at the heart of your own new work: you.  Through his books, McGraw has changed the lives of millions. In introducing the world to his matter-of-fact, tell-it-like-it-is philosophy of life, Dr. Phil, as he is known to his legions of fans, has put an end to the \"everyone's a victim\" attitude that had taken hold of our culture. Published in over twenty-five countries, and with millions of books sold, his two number one bestsellers, Life Strategies and Relationship Rescue, forced readers to take a serious look at the excuses they had so long been clinging to as to why they were not happy, not successful, and not enjoying their one chance at living.  Now, Dr. Phil takes those lessons a great leap further and explores one of the most challenging questions facing us all: When you look in the mirror, who is truly hiding beneath that face? Instead of taking a surface look at the way we live our lives, Dr. Phil demystifies how your self-concept came to be and gives a nuts-and-bolts approach to creating a new plan for living and, in turn, for discovering the real you.  In this groundbreaking work, Dr. Phil challenges you to find your \"authentic self\" -- that person you once were before life took its toll. It is you at your greatest, most fulfilled, most real moment. It is the person you have always wanted to be, but were too distracted, busy, or scared to become. Instead, you have created a \"fictional self\" -- taking on the identity of who you believe you are supposed be, the person people tell you you are. The incongruence between these two selves is what leads you to feel that your life is incomplete, unbalanced, and altogether more difficult than it really should be.  The good news is it no longer needs to be that way. By using the plan set forth in Self Matters, Dr. Phil helps you to demystify your self-concept and learn how to reclaim your authentic self. In evaluating your life by only the facts, you can learn to think beyond the excuses and fears that have masked the person you have always wanted to be. Self Matters is one of the most forward-thinking works on self-concept and self-esteem ever published. For the first time, an author tells it how it is and, in the process, teaches us all how to live the lives we have always wanted but prevented ourselves from living. We get only one chance in this world, and now, Dr. Phil shows all how to make the most of it.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Self Help", "Spirituality", "Mental Health", "Philosophy", "Relationships", "Personal Development", "Inspirational", "Health", "Nonfiction"]}, "6114790": {"bookid": "6114790", "title": "Healing Through Poetry", "author": "Mary Ann Duhart", "series": "", "ratings": "8", "reviews": "5", "rating": "4.88", "description": "While facing the challenges of life struggles, addictions from within, generational curses and trying to keep peace of mind, I found healing through writing.

Clinton painstakingly outlines the history behind his greatest successes and failures, including his dedication to educational and economic reform, his war against a \"vast right-wing operation\" determined to destroy him, and the \"morally indefensible\" acts for which he was nearly impeached. My Life is autobiography as therapy--a personal history written by a man trying to face and banish his private demons. Clinton approaches the story of his youth with gusto, sharing tales of giant watermelons, nine-pound tumors, a charging ram, famous mobsters and jazz musicians, and a BB gun standoff. He offers an equally energetic portrait of American history, pop culture, and the evolving political landscape, covering the historical events that shaped his early years (namely the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and JFK) and the events that shaped his presidency (Waco, Bosnia, Somalia). What makes My Life remarkable as a political memoir is how thoroughly it is infused with Clinton's unassuming, charmingly pithy voice: I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts, and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged only by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain. However, that same voice might tire readers as Clinton applies his penchant for minute details to a distractible laundry list of events, from his youth through the years of his presidency. Not wanting to forget a single detail that might help account for his actions, Clinton overdoes it--do we really need to know the name of his childhood barber? But when Clinton sticks to the meat of his story--recollections about Mother, his abusive stepfather, Hillary, the campaign trail, and Kenneth Starr--the veracity of emotion and Kitchen Confidential-type revelations about \"what it is like to be President\" make My Life impossible to put down. To Clinton, \"politics is a contact sport,\" and while he claims that My Life is not intended to make excuses or assign blame, it does portray him as a fighter whose strategy is to \"take the first hit, then counterpunch as hard as I could.\" While My Life is primarily a stroll through Clinton's memories, it is also a scathing rebuke--a retaliation against his detractors, including Kenneth Starr, whose \"mindless search for scandal\" protected the guilty while \"persecuting the innocent\" and distracted his Administration from pressing international matters (including strikes on al Qaeda). Counterpunch indeed. At its core, My Life is a charming and intriguing if flawed book by an equally intriguing and flawed man who had his worst failures and humiliations made public. Ultimately, the man who left office in the shadow of scandal offers an honest and open account of his life, allowing readers to witness his struggle to \"drain the most out of every moment\" while maintaining the character with which he was raised. It is a remarkably intimate, persuasive look at the boy he was, the President he became, and man he is today. --Daphne Durham\n", "genres": ["Autobiography", "Politics", "Memoir", "American History", "History", "Biography Memoir", "North American Hi...", "Audiobook", "Nonfiction", "Presidents", "Biography"]}, "93728": {"bookid": "93728", "title": "Princess in Love", "author": "Meg Cabot", "series": "(The Princess Diaries #3)", "ratings": "55630", "reviews": "1698", "rating": "3.78", "description": "Princess Mia may seem like the luckiest girl ever.But the truth is, Mia spends all her time doing one of three things: preparing for her nerve-racking entr\u00e9e into Genovian society, slogging through the congestion unique to Manhattan in December, and avoiding further smooching from her hapless boyfriend, Kenny.For Mia, being princess is not the fairy tale it's supposed to b\nPrincess Mia may seem like the luckiest girl ever.But the truth is, Mia spends all her time doing one of three things: preparing for her nerve-racking entr\u00e9e into Genovian society, slogging through the congestion unique to Manhattan in December, and avoiding further smooching from her hapless boyfriend, Kenny.For Mia, being princess is not the fairy tale it's supposed to be . . . or is it?\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Realistic Fiction", "Childrens", "Chick Lit", "Teen", "Romance", "Humor", "Contemporary", "Audiobook", "Young Adult", "Womens Fiction"]}, "820073": {"bookid": "820073", "title": "Level 7", "author": "Mordecai Roshwald", "series": "", "ratings": "1749", "reviews": "166", "rating": "3.94", "description": "Level 7 is the diary of Officer X-127, who is assigned to stand guard at the \"Push Buttons,\" a machine devised to activate the atomic destruction of the enemy, in the country\u2019s deepest bomb shelter.

Even today, coal generates almost 45 percent of the world's power. Our modern technological society would be inconceivable without coal and the energy it provides. Unfortunately, that society will not survive unless we wean ourselves off coal. The largest single source of greenhouse gases, coal is responsible for 43 percent of the world's carbon emissions. Richard Martin, author of SuperFuel, argues that to limit catastrophic climate change, we must find a way to power our world with less polluting energy sources, and we must do it in the next couple of decades--or else it is game over. It won't be easy: as coal plants shut down across the United States, and much of Europe turns to natural gas, coal use is growing in the booming economies of Asia-- particularly China and India. Even in Germany, where nuclear power stations are being phased out in the wake of the Fukushima accident, coal use is growing. Led by the Sierra Club and its ambitious Beyond Coal campaign, environmentalists hope to drastically reduce our dependence on coal in the next decade. But doing so will require an unprecedented contraction of an established, lucrative, and politically influential worldwide industry. Big Coal will not go gently. And its decline will dramatically change lives everywhere--from Appalachian coal miners and coal company executives to activists in China's nascent environmental movement.Based on a series of journeys into the heart of coal land, from Wyoming to West Virginia to China's remote Shanxi Province, hundreds of interviews with people involved in, or affected by, the effort to shrink the industry, and deep research into the science, technology, and economics of the coal industry, Coal Wars chronicles the dramatic stories behind coal's big shutdown--and the industry's desperate attempts to remain a global behemoth.

In true emulative and contrarian style, Hitchens is both admiring and aggressive, sympathetic yet critical, taking true measure of his subject as hero and problem. Answering both the detractors and the false claimants, Hitchens tears down the fa\u00e7ade of sainthood erected by the hagiographers and rebuts the critics point by point. He examines Orwell and his perspectives on fascism, empire, feminism, and Englishness, as well as his outlook on America, a country and culture towards which he exhibited much ambivalence. Whether thinking about empires or dictators, race or class, nationalism or popular culture, Orwell's moral outlook remains indispensable in a world that has undergone vast changes in the fifty years since his death. Combining the best of Hitchens's polemical punch and intellectual elegance in a tightly woven and subtle argument, this book addresses not only why Orwell matters today, but how he will continue to matter in a future, uncertain world. Christopher Hitchens, one of the most incisive minds of our own age, meets Orwell on the page in this provocative encounter of wit, contention and moral truth.\n", "genres": ["Criticism", "Literature", "Politics", "Philosophy", "Writing", "History", "Biography Memoir", "Essays", "Nonfiction", "Biography", "Literary Criticism"]}, "68452": {"bookid": "68452", "title": "Pani Jeziora", "author": "Andrzej Sapkowski", "series": "(The Witcher #5)", "ratings": "59163", "reviews": "3465", "rating": "4.13", "description": "Jaki los czeka wied\u017amina?

Then one cool October morning he rose early, drove into town, walked into the church, and calmly shot and killed his pastor and friend, the Reverend Dexter Bell. As if the murder weren't shocking enough, it was even more baffling that Pete's only statement about it--to the sheriff, to his lawyers, to the judge, to the jury, and to his family--was: \"I have nothing to say.\" He was not afraid of death and was willing to take his motive to the grave. In a major novel unlike anything he has written before, John Grisham takes us on an incredible journey, from the Jim Crow South to the jungles of the Philippines during World War II; from an insane asylum filled with secrets to the Clanton courtroom where Pete's defense attorney tries desperately to save him.  Reminiscent of the finest tradition of Southern Gothic storytelling, The Reckoning would not be complete without Grisham's signature layers of legal suspense, and he delivers on every page.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Mystery Thriller", "Historical Fiction", "Legal Thriller", "Historical", "Crime", "Suspense", "Audiobook", "Thriller"]}, "388997": {"bookid": "388997", "title": "She Stoops to Conquer", "author": "Oliver Goldsmith", "series": "", "ratings": "11428", "reviews": "337", "rating": "3.63", "description": "This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.

Through larger-than-life characters and an inspired story line, Flatterland explores our present understanding of the shape and origins of the universe, the nature of space, time, and matter, as well as modern geometries and their applications. The journey begins when our heroine, Victoria Line, comes upon her great-great-grandfather A. Square's diary, hidden in the attic. The writings help her to contact the Space Hopper, who becomes her guide and mentor through eleven dimensions.

It is populated by oddballs, weirdoes, comedians, eccentrics, head cases, prima donnas and hard cases. But no more so than when you're a white English guy working Watts, Compton and Inglewood, home to the infamous Bloods and Crips. I truly never knew what to expect next, and during my time driving cab in South-Central L.A. in the 1980's I got myself into some scrapes. I\u2019ve intended to paint an ominous picture of a community destroyed by drugs, guns and violence. You\u2019ll almost smell the omnipresent whiff of cheap wine, and feel the dirty lino under your feet.

You may well be able to relate to guys who used their fists and their wits, you may laugh at their humour and get their jokes, but it\u2019ll be the thugs with guns and no soul who will unsettle you. I want you to be scared of them.

But this book had me hooked from the 1st few lines. I've never finished a book this quickly. Highly recommended to anyone!!\u201d\u201cAbsolutely incredible! I read the sample and had to buy the book. I usually never buy books and just find them online but I had to make the exception for this due to the author's eloquence. The stories are really funny and serious when they need to be. I definitely would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a genuinely straight up genius work.

Historical expertise marries page-turning fiction in Alison Weir\u2019s enthralling debut novel, breathing new life into one of the most significant and tumultuous periods of the English monarchy. It is the story of Lady Jane Grey\u2013\u201cthe Nine Days\u2019 Queen\u201d \u2013a fifteen-year-old girl who unwittingly finds herself at the center of the religious and civil unrest that nearly toppled the fabled House of Tudor during the sixteenth century.  The child of a scheming father and a ruthless mother, for whom she is merely a pawn in a dynastic game with the highest stakes, Jane Grey was born during the harrowingly turbulent period between Anne Boleyn\u2019s beheading and the demise of Jane\u2019s infamous great-uncle, King Henry VIII. With the premature passing of Jane\u2019 s adolescent cousin, and Henry\u2019s successor, King Edward VI, comes a struggle for supremacy fueled by political machinations and lethal religious fervor.   Unabashedly honest and exceptionally intelligent, Jane possesses a sound strength of character beyond her years that equips her to weather the vicious storm. And though she has no ambitions to rule, preferring to immerse herself in books and religious studies, she is forced to accept the crown, and by so doing sets off a firestorm of intrigue, betrayal, and tragedy.  Alison Weir uses her unmatched skills as a historian to enliven the many dynamic characters of this majestic drama. Along with Lady Jane Grey, Weir vividly renders her devious parents; her much-loved nanny; the benevolent Queen Katherine Parr; Jane\u2019s ambitious cousins; the Catholic \u201cBloody\u201d Mary, who will stop at nothing to seize the throne; and the Protestant and future queen Elizabeth. Readers venture inside royal drawing rooms and bedchambers to witness the power-grabbing that swirls around Lady Jane Grey from the day of her birth to her unbearably poignant death. Innocent Traitor paints a complete and compelling portrait of this captivating young woman, a faithful servant of God whose short reign and brief life would make her a legend.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Literature", "Religion", "British Literature", "Historical Fiction", "European Literature", "English History", "Adult", "Historical", "Adult Fiction", "Tudor Period", "16th Century", "Audiobook"]}, "7198988": {"bookid": "7198988", "title": "Dark Flame", "author": "Alyson Noel", "series": "(The Immortals #4)", "ratings": "60714", "reviews": "1899", "rating": "3.73", "description": "In Alyson No\u00ebl\u2019s most darkly seductive Immortals novel yet, Ever fights for control of her body, her soul\u2014and the timeless true love she\u2019s been chasing for centuries.Ever is trying to help Haven make the transition into life as an immortal.

First published in 1979 to critical acclaim, winning the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, The Gnostic Gospels has continued to grow in reputation and influence over the past two decades. It is now widely recognized as one of the most brilliant and accessible histories of early Christian spirituality published in our time.In 1945 an Egyptian peasant unearthed what proved to be the Gnostic Gospels, thirteen papyrus volumes that expounded a radically different view of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ from that of the New Testament. In this spellbinding book, renowned religious scholar Elaine Pagels elucidates the mysteries and meanings of these sacred texts both in the world of the first Christians and in the context of Christianity today.With insight and passion, Pagels explores a remarkable range of recently discovered gospels, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, to show how a variety of \u201cChristianities\u201d emerged at a time of extraordinary spiritual upheaval. Some Christians questioned the need for clergy and church doctrine, and taught that the divine could be discovered through spiritual search. Many others, like Buddhists and Hindus, sought enlightenment \u2014 and access to God \u2014 within. Such explorations raised questions: Was the resurrection to be understood symbolically and not literally? Was God to be envisioned only in masculine form, or feminine as well? Was martyrdom a necessary \u2014 or worthy \u2014 expression of faith? These early Christians dared to ask questions that orthodox Christians later suppressed \u2014 and their explorations led to profoundly different visions of Jesus and his message. Brilliant, provocative, and stunning in its implications, The Gnostic Gospels is a radical, eloquent reconsideration of the origins of the Christian faith.\n", "genres": ["Religion", "Christianity", "Theology", "Spirituality", "Mythology", "Philosophy", "Fantasy", "Gnosticism", "History", "Christian", "Nonfiction"]}, "254291": {"bookid": "254291", "title": "Seven Brothers", "author": "Aleksis Kivi", "series": "", "ratings": "3347", "reviews": "148", "rating": "3.36", "description": "Along with The Kalevala, Aleksis Kivi's Seven Brothers is Finland's most celebrated literary treasure.

In The Body Keeps the Score, he transforms our understanding of traumatic stress, revealing how it literally rearranges the brain\u2019s wiring\u2014specifically areas dedicated to pleasure, engagement, control, and trust. He shows how these areas can be reactivated through innovative treatments including neurofeedback, mindfulness techniques, play, yoga, and other therapies. Based on Dr. van der Kolk\u2019s own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score offers proven alternatives to drugs and talk therapy\u2014and a way to reclaim lives.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Self Help", "Mental Health", "Social Work", "Counselling", "Science", "Personal Development", "Health", "Social Science", "Audiobook", "Nonfiction"]}, "16158494": {"bookid": "16158494", "title": "Finding Your Element: How to Discover Your Talents and Passions and Transform Your Life", "author": "Ken Robinson", "series": "", "ratings": "5389", "reviews": "336", "rating": "3.82", "description": "Ken Robinson's groundbreaking New York Times bestseller, The Element, introduced readers to a new concept of self-fulfillment and has inspired readers around the world.

Rooted in the two thousand-year-old wisdom of the Tao Te Ching--\"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\"--Kaizen is the art of making great and lasting change through small, steady increments. Kaizen is the tortoise versus the hare. Kaizen is the eleven Fortune 500 companies that significantly outperformed the market through moderate, step-by-step actions. Kaizen is losing weight not by a crash diet (which more often than not crashes) but by eating one bite less at each meal--then, a month later, eating two bites less. Kaizen is starting a life-changing exercise program by standing--just standing--on a treadmill for one minute a day. Written by an expert on Kaizen--Dr. Robert Maurer, a psychologist on the staff at the UCLA medical school who speaks and consults nationally--\"One Small Step\" is the gentle but potent way to effect change. Beginning by outlining the all-important role that fear plays in all types of change--and Kaizen's ability to circumvent it--Dr. Maurer then explains the 7 Small Steps: how to Think Small Thoughts, Take Small Actions, Solve Small Problems, and more. He shows how to perform mind sculpture--visualizing virtual change so that real change comes more naturally. Why small rewards motivate better than big rewards. How great discoveries are made by paying attention to the little details most of us overlook. Hundreds of examples of Kaizen at work grace the book, as well as quotes from W. Edwards Deming (who brought Kaizen to Japanese industry), Peter Drucker, coach John Wooden, and others.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Self Help", "Audiobook", "Philosophy", "Personal Development", "Productivity", "Leadership", "Management", "Business", "Nonfiction"]}, "6081261": {"bookid": "6081261", "title": "What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20", "author": "Tina Seelig", "series": "", "ratings": "9337", "reviews": "1013", "rating": "3.84", "description": "Major life transitions such as leaving the protected environment of school or starting a new career can be daunting.

Now, in this important work of historical restoration, Amos Elon takes us back to the beginning, chronicling a period of achievement and integration that at its peak produced a golden age second only to the Renaissance.Writing with a novelist's eye, Elon shows how a persecuted clan of cattle dealers and wandering peddlers was transformed into a stunningly successful community of writers, philosophers, scientists, tycoons and activists. He peoples his account with dramatic figures: Moses Mendelssohn, who entered Berlin in 1743 through the gate reserved for Jews and cattle, and went on to become \"the German Socrates;\" Heinrich Heine, beloved lyric poet who famously referred to baptism as the admission ticket to European culture; Hannah Arendt, whose flight from Berlin signaled the end of the German-Jewish idyll. Elon traces how this minority-never more than one percent of the population-came to be perceived as a deadly threat to national integrity, and he movingly demonstrates that this devastating outcome was uncertain almost until the end.A collective biography, full of depth and compassion, The Pity of It All summons up a splendid world and a dream of integration and tolerance that, despite all, remains the essential ennobling project of modernity.(less)\n", "genres": ["Literature", "Religion", "European History", "Biography", "Judaism", "Holocaust", "Germany", "History", "Cultural", "World War II", "Judaica", "Nonfiction", "Jewish"]}, "12958487": {"bookid": "12958487", "title": "Lady Luck", "author": "Kristen Ashley", "series": "(Colorado Mountain #3)", "ratings": "37714", "reviews": "2321", "rating": "4.41", "description": "Is love in the cards?Since birth, Lexie Berry has had nothing but bad luck.

Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.\n", "genres": ["Politics", "Us Presidents", "American History", "Historical", "History", "Biography Memoir", "North American Hi...", "Audiobook", "Nonfiction", "Presidents", "Biography"]}, "6454453": {"bookid": "6454453", "title": "The Devil's Punchbowl", "author": "Greg Iles", "series": "(Penn Cage #3)", "ratings": "19038", "reviews": "1389", "rating": "4.09", "description": "From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Penn Cage series comes an electrifying thriller that reveals a world of depravity, sex, violence, and the corruption of a Southern town.As a prosecuting attorney in Houston, Penn Cage sent hardened killers to death row.

But it is as mayor of his hometown\u2014Natchez, Mississippi\u2014that Penn will face his most dangerous threat. Urged by old friends to try to restore this fading jewel of the Old South, Penn has ridden into office on a tide of support for change. But in its quest for new jobs and fresh money, Natchez, like other Mississippi towns, has turned to casino gambling, and now five fantastical steamboats float on the river beside the old slave market at Natchez like props from Gone With the Wind. But one boat isn't like the others. Rumor has it that the Magnolia Queen has found a way to pull the big players from Las Vegas to its Mississippi backwater. And with them\u2014on sleek private jets that slip in and out of town like whispers in the night\u2014come pro football players, rap stars, and international gamblers, all sharing an unquenchable taste for one thing: blood sport\u2014and the dark vices that go with it. When a childhood friend of Penn's who brings him evidence of these crimes is brutally murdered, the full weight of Penn's failure to protect his city hits home. So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone, for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake, Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor: -Caitlin Masters, the lover Penn found in The Quiet Can Game and lost in Turning Angel -Danny McDavitt, the heroic helicopter pilot from Third Degree -Tom Cage, Penn's father and legendary local family physician -Walt Garrity, a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean War Together they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate\u2014and counter\u2014their every move. Ultimately, victory will depend on a bold stroke that will leave one of Penn's allies dead\u2014and Natchez changed forever. After appearing in two of Iles's most popular novels, Penn Cage makes his triumphant return as a brilliant, honorable, and courageous hero.

Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman parts the curtains of secrecy to show how Cheney operated, why, and what he wrought.Angler, Gellman\u2019s embargoed and highly explosive book, is a work of careful, concrete, and original reporting backed by hundreds of interviews with close Cheney allies as well as rivals, many speaking candidly on the record for the first time. On the signature issues of war and peace, Angler takes readers behind the scenes as Cheney maneuvers for dominance on what he calls the iron issues from Iraq, Iran, and North Korea to executive supremacy, interrogation of Al Qaeda suspects, and domestic espionage. Gellman explores the behind-the- scenes story of Cheney\u2019s tremendous influence on foreign policy, exposing how he misled the four ranking members of Congress with faulty intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, how he derailed Bush from venturing into Israeli- Palestinian peace talks for nearly five years, and how his policy left North Korea and Iran free to make major advances in their nuclear programs.Domestically, Gellman details Cheney\u2019s role as \u201csuper Chief of Staff \u201d, enforcer of conservative orthodoxy; gatekeeper of Supreme Court nominees; referee of Cabinet turf; editor of tax and budget laws; and regulator in chief of the administration\u2019s environment policy.

Gellman exposes the mechanics of Cheney\u2019s largely successful post-September 11 campaign to win unchecked power for the commander in chief, and reflects upon, and perhaps changes, the legacy that Cheney\u2014and the Bush administration as a whole\u2014will leave as they exit office.\n", "genres": ["United States", "Politics", "War", "American History", "Writing", "Journalism", "History", "Biography Memoir", "North American Hi...", "Nonfiction", "Presidents", "Biography"]}, "1789979": {"bookid": "1789979", "title": "In Heaven as on Earth: A Vision of the Afterlife", "author": "M.

While recuperating from wartime Warsaw in the Polish countryside, the unnamed narrator and his friend, Fryderyk, attempt to force amour between two local youths, Karol and Henia, as a kind of a lewd entertainment. They become increasingly frustrated as they discover that the two have no interest in one another, and the games are momentarily stopped by a local murder and a directive to assassinate a rogue member of the Polish resistance.

And how do governments founded upon the defense of individual rights degenerate into tyranny? These are the questions addressed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, a strikingly original inquiry into much-explored issues of 18th-century (and subsequent) philosophy: human nature and the best form of government.Rousseau takes an innovative approach by introducing a \"hypothetical history\" that presents a theoretical view of people in a pre-social condition and the ensuing effects of civilization. In his sweeping account of humanity's social and political development, the author develops a theory of human evolution that prefigures Darwinian thought and encompasses aspects of ethics, sociology, and epistemology. He concludes that people are inevitably corrupt as a result of both natural (or physical) inequalities and moral (or political) inequalities.One of the most influential works of the Enlightenment, the Discourse on the Origin of Inequality offers a thought-provoking account of society's origins and a keen criticism of unequal modern political institutions.\n", "genres": ["18th Century", "Literature", "Politics", "Political Science", "Philosophy", "Academic", "School", "Classics", "Sociology", "Cultural", "France", "History", "Nonfiction"]}, "22326": {"bookid": "22326", "title": "Virtual Light", "author": "William Gibson", "series": "(Bridge #1)", "ratings": "24039", "reviews": "625", "rating": "3.86", "description": "Berry Rydell, an ex-cop, signs on with IntenSecure Armed Response in Los Angeles.

The decadent 1920s and 1930s in New York were a time of great experiment and daring for women. For the rich, life seemed a continual party, but the excesses took their emotional toll. In the bitingly witty poems and stories collected here, along with her articles and reviews, she brilliantly captures the spirit of the decadent Jazz Age in New York, exposing both the dazzle and the darkness. But beneath the sharp perceptions and acidic humour, much of her work poignantly expresses the deep vulnerability of a troubled, self-destructive woman who, in the words of philosopher Irwin Edman, was 'a Sappho who could combine a heartbreak with a wisecrack'.Dorothy Parker (1893-1967) was born in West End, New Jersey, and grew up in New York. In 1916 she sold some of her poetry to the editor of Vogue, and was subsequently given an editorial position on the magazine. She then became drama critic of Vanity Fair and the central figure of the celebrated Algonquin Round Table, whose members included George S. Kaufman and Harpo Marx. Her collections of poems included Enough Rope (1926) and Not So Deep as a Well (1936), and her collections of stories included Here Lies (1939); in addition, she collaborated on and wrote screenplays including the Oscar-winning A Star is Born (1937), and Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942).If you enjoyed The Collected Dorothy Parker, you might like Truman Capote's The Complete Stories, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.'She managed to express her real feelings in stanzas which snap and glitter like a Chanel handbag'Peter Ackroyd, The Times\n", "genres": ["Poetry", "Short Stories", "Fiction", "Literature", "Modern Classics", "Humor", "Classics", "Writing", "Feminism", "American", "Essays"]}, "24815": {"bookid": "24815", "title": "The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes", "author": "Bill Watterson", "series": "(Calvin and Hobbes)", "ratings": "21220", "reviews": "446", "rating": "4.68", "description": "They're back: Calvin, the six-year-old dirty tricksmeister and master of indignation and his warm, cuddly philosopher sidekick, Hobbes.

Advertised only by word of mouth, the book became a favorite training and counseling guide in many institutions -- government, church, business -- and colleges across the nation adopted it as an auxiliary text in a dozen different departments. Why? Perhaps it was the user-friendly way that Please Understand Me helped people find their personality style. Perhaps it was the simple accuracy of Keirsey's portraits of temperament and character types. Or perhaps it was the book's essential message: that members of families and institutions are OK, even though they are fundamentally different from each other, and that they would all do well to appreciate their differences and give up trying to change others into copies of themselves.Now: Please Understand Me IIFor the past twenty years Keirsey has continued to investigate personality differences -- to refine his theory of the four temperaments and to define the facets of character that distinguish one from another. His findings form the basis of Please Understand Me II, an updated and greatly expanded edition of the book, far more comprehensive and coherent than the original, and yet with much of the same easy accessibility. One major addition is Keirsey's view of how the temperaments differ in the intelligent roles they are most likely to develop. Each of us, he says, has four kinds of intelligence -- tactical, logistical, diplomatic, strategic -- though one of the four interests us far more than the others, and thus gets far more practice than the rest. Like four suits in a hand of cards, we each have a long suit and a short suit in what interests us and what we do well, and fortunate indeed are those whose work matches their skills. As in the original book, Please Understand Me II begins with The Keirsey Temperament Sorter, the most used personality inventory in the world. But also included is The Keirsey Four-Types Sorter, a new short questionnaire that identifies one's basic temperament and then ranks one's second, third, and fourth choices. Share this new sorter with friends and family, and get set for a lively and fascinating discussion of personal styles.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Self Help", "Language", "Philosophy", "Relationships", "Personal Development", "Writing", "Parenting", "Reference", "Business", "Nonfiction"]}, "23419": {"bookid": "23419", "title": "The Consolations of Philosophy", "author": "Alain de Botton", "series": "", "ratings": "26727", "reviews": "2607", "rating": "4.01", "description": "Alain de Botton's The Consolations of Philosophy takes the discipline of logic and the mind back to its roots.

Cool, eloquent, raising two fatherless children, Claire has emerged as the most visible of the widows who became a potent political force in the aftermath of the catastrophe. She longs for her husband, but she has found her mission: she sits on a jury charged with selecting a fitting memorial for the victims of the attack. Of the thousands of anonymous submissions that she and her fellow jurors examine, one transfixes Claire: a garden on whose walls the names of the dead are inscribed. But when the winning envelope is opened, they find the designer is Mohammad Khan - Mo - an enigmatic Muslim-American who, it seems, feels no need to represent anyone's beliefs except his own. When the design and its creator are leaked, a media firestorm erupts, and Claire finds herself trying to balance principles against emotions amid escalating tensions about the place of Islam in America.A remarkably bold and ambitious debut, The Submission is peopled with journalists, activists, mourners, and bureaucrats who struggle for advantage and fight for their ideals. In this deeply humane novel, the breadth of Amy Waldman's cast of characters is matched by her startling ability to conjure individual lives from their own points of view.

Initially, the novel was rejected by several Spanish-language publishers, but became an instant best seller when published in Barcelona in 1982. The novel was critically acclaimed around the world, and catapulted Allende to literary stardom. That same year, the novel was named Best Novel of the Year in Chile, and she received the country's Panorama Literario award. The novel has been translated to over 20 languages worldwide. The book was first conceived by Isabel Allende when she received news that her grandfather was dying, and she began to write him a letter that ultimately became the starting manuscript of The House of the Spirits. The story details the life of the Trueba family, spanning four generations, and tracing the post-colonial social and political upheavals of the Latin American country they live in. The story is told mainly from the perspective of two protagonists (Esteban and Alba) and incorporates elements of magic realism. Some readers claim that the novel is a roman a clef. According to them, The Poet in the novel is probably Pablo Neruda, and Allende's cousin, once removed Salvador Allende, is both The Candidate and The President. The House of Spirits chronicles the lives of three generations of the Trueba family of Chile. The story starts, however, with the del Valle family, focusing on Clara and Rosa, mainly.

In gripping detail, acclaimed New Yorker writer and bestselling author, Jane Mayer, relates the impact of these decisions\u2014U.S.-held prisoners, some of them completely innocent, were subjected to treatment more reminiscent of the Spanish Inquisition than the twenty-first century.The Dark Side will chronicle real, specific cases, shown in real time against the larger tableau of what was happening in Washington, looking at the intelligence gained\u2014or not\u2014and the price paid.

Reading The Varieties of Religious Experience, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which \"the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions.\" It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.\n", "genres": ["Psychology", "Religion", "Theology", "Spirituality", "Mysticism", "Philosophy", "Science", "Occult", "Classics", "History", "Nonfiction"]}, "1691091": {"bookid": "1691091", "title": "Charleston Receipts", "author": "Junior League of Charleston", "series": "", "ratings": "177", "reviews": "13", "rating": "4.33", "description": "Charleston Receipts was first published in 1950 and is the oldest Junior League cookbook still in print.

Now, in her most intimate and seamlessly crafted work to date, Adichie turns her penetrating eye on not only Nigeria but America, in twelve dazzling stories that explore the ties that bind men and women, parents and children, Africa and the United States.In \"A Private Experience,\" a medical student hides from a violent riot with a poor Muslim woman whose dignity and faith force her to confront the realities and fears she's been pushing away. In \"Tomorrow is Too Far,\" a woman unlocks the devastating secret that surrounds her brother's death. The young mother at the center of \"Imitation\" finds her comfortable life in Philadelphia threatened when she learns that her husband has moved his mistress into their Lagos home. And the title story depicts the choking loneliness of a Nigerian girl who moves to an America that turns out to be nothing like the country she expected; though falling in love brings her desires nearly within reach, a death in her homeland forces her to reexamine them.Searing and profound, suffused with beauty, sorrow, and longing, these stories map, with Adichie's signature emotional wisdom, the collision of two cultures and the deeply human struggle to reconcile them. The Thing Around Your Neck is a resounding confirmation of the prodigious literary powers of one of our most essential writers.\n", "genres": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Literature", "African Literature", "Nigeria", "Adult", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "Cultural", "Feminism", "Audiobook", "Western Africa", "Africa"]}, "337058": {"bookid": "337058", "title": "Jacob Have I Loved", "author": "Katherine Paterson", "series": "", "ratings": "32470", "reviews": "2135", "rating": "3.68", "description": "Esau have I hated . . .

Harris contends that one must begin with a new attitude, viewing love, purity, and singleness from God's perspective rather than thinking that love and romance are to be enjoyed \"solely for recreation.\" In such well-named chapters as \"Guarding Your Heart\" and \"What Matters at Fifty,\" Harris encourages the reader to look at one's character rather than reveling in infatuation, to regard love as a truly selfless, biblical act rather than a feeling. He refutes the concept that we are victims of \"falling in love\" (that it is beyond our control), saying that \"God wants us to seek guidance from scriptural truth, not feeling. Smart love looks beyond personal desires and the gratification of the moment. It looks at the big picture: serving others and glorifying God.\" Before you roll your eyes, moaning that this sounds terribly unromantic, know that Harris does a superb job of couching his convictions in the sincere belief that if we are purposeful in our singleness and date with integrity, a fulfilled marriage awaits us--in God's timing. --Jill Heatherly\n", "genres": ["Religion", "Christianity", "Marriage", "Self Help", "Christian Living", "Relationships", "Romance", "Christian Non Fiction", "Christian", "Nonfiction"]}, "561182": {"bookid": "561182", "title": "The Club of Queer Trades", "author": "G.K.

And of the few who have known this dangerous way of life, fewer still can recount their adventures with the flair of this former professional hunter-turned-writer.Based on Capstick's own experiences and the personal accounts of his colleagues, Death in the Long Grass portrays the great killers of the African bush-- not only the lion, leopard, and elephant, but the primitive rhino and the crocodile waiting for its unsuspecting prey, the titanic hippo and the Cape buffalo charging like an express train out of control.

Auel brings the ice-age epic Earth's Children series to an extraordinary conclusion. Ayla, one of the most remarkable and beloved heroines in contemporary fiction, continues to explore the world and the people around her with curiosity, insight, and above all, courage.As the story opens, Ayla, Jondalar, and their infant daughter, Jonayla are welcomed by the Zelandonii, but problems arise. They are faced with new challenges, not just the ordinary trials of sheer survival, but the complications posed by many groups of people who need to live and work together. The wisdom that Ayla gained from her struggles as an orphaned child, alone in a hostile environment, strengthens her as she moves closer to leadership of the Zelandonia.Ayla and Jondalar's first priority is the care for their golden-haired child, Jonayla, and the well-being of their amazing animals, Wolf, Whinney, Racer, and Gray. The two participate in hunts to provide food, in travels to Summer Meetings for decision making, and in social activities. Whatever the obstacles, Ayla's inventive spirit produces new ways to lessen the difficulties of daily life: searching for wild edibles to make delicious meals, experimenting with techniques to ease the long journeys the Zelandoni must take, honing her skills as a healer and a leader. And then, there are the Sacred Caves, the caves that Ayla's mentor--the Donier, the First of the Zelandonia--takes her to see. These caves are filled with remarkable art--paintings of mammoths, lions, aurochs, rhinoceros, reindeer, bison, bear. The powerful, mystical aura within these caves sometimes overwhelms Ayla.Ayla's final preparations for her initiation as a Zelandoni bring The Land of Painted Caves to a riveting climax. So much time apart from Jondalar has caused him to drift away from her. The rituals themselves bring her close to death. But through those rituals, Ayla gains A Gift of Knowledge so important that it will change the world.Spellbinding drama, meticulous research, fascinating detail, and superb narrative skill combine to make The Land of Painted Caves a captivating, utterly believable creation of a civilization that resonates long after the reader has turned the last page, and serves as an astonishing end to this beloved saga.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Prehistoric", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Adult", "Historical", "Adult Fiction", "Audiobook"]}, "117531": {"bookid": "117531", "title": "Dark Night of the Soul", "author": "John of the Cross", "series": "", "ratings": "9931", "reviews": "317", "rating": "4.14", "description": "", "genres": ["Poetry", "Catholic", "Theology", "Religion", "Christianity", "Spirituality", "Faith", "Classics", "Christian", "Nonfiction"]}, "1662396": {"bookid": "1662396", "title": "Mockingbird", "author": "Walter Tevis", "series": "", "ratings": "6777", "reviews": "799", "rating": "4.16", "description": "Mockingbird is a powerful novel of a future world where humans are dying.

Torn from their homes and families, these men, women, and children were loaded into shipboard cattle stalls and abandoned in a lawless place where brutality held sway. Many did not have leprosy, and many who did were not contagious, yet all were ensnared in a shared nightmare. Here, for the first time, John Tayman reveals the complete history of the Molokai settlement and its unforgettable inhabitants. It's an epic of ruthless manhunts, thrilling escapes, bizarre medical experiments, and tragic, irreversible error. Carefully researched and masterfully told, The Colony is a searing tale of individual bravery and extraordinary survival, and stands as a testament to the power of faith, compassion, and the human spirit.\n", "genres": ["Illness", "Adventure", "Science", "Disease", "Medical", "American History", "Historical", "Health", "Survival", "History", "North American Hi...", "Nonfiction", "Medicine", "Biography"]}, "161651": {"bookid": "161651", "title": "Emily Post's Etiquette", "author": "Peggy Post", "series": "", "ratings": "2436", "reviews": "209", "rating": "4.16", "description": "Features twenty new chapters that cover such areas as Internet behavior, raising well-mannered children, dating, post-September 11 travel etiquette, tipping, and observing religious cere", "genres": ["Psychology", "Education", "Self Help", "Language", "How To", "Classics", "Communication", "History", "Reference", "Business", "Nonfiction"]}, "18513832": {"bookid": "18513832", "title": "Memoir of the repentant people", "author": "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0641\u064a", "series": "", "ratings": "69", "reviews": "3", "rating": "4.46", "description": "Allah loves those who sincerely seek His forgiveness and want to live a life of obedience.

The answer is agility\u2014emotional agility.Emotional agility is a four-step approach that allows us to navigate life\u2019s twists and turns with self-acceptance, clear-sightedness, and an open mind. In her more than twenty years of research, Susan David has found that no matter how intelligent, resilient, or creative people are, when they ignore how situations or interactions make them feel, they miss opportunities to gain insight, getting hooked by thoughts, emotions, and habits that prevent them from reaching their full potential. Emotionally agile people experience the same stresses and setbacks as anyone else, but they know how to adapt, aligning their actions with their values and making small changes that lead to a life of growth.Drawing on her extensive professional research, her international consulting work, and her own experiences growing up in Apartheid-era South Africa and losing her father at a young age, David shows how anyone can become more emotionally agile and thrive in an uncertain world.

He was restless and lacked direction, and the idea of dropping everything and moving to the ends of the Earth was irresistibly romantic. He should have known better. The Sex Lives of Cannibals tells the hilarious story of what happens when Troost discovers that Tarawa is not the island paradise he dreamed of. Falling into one amusing misadventure after another, Troost struggles through relentless, stifling heat, a variety of deadly bacteria, polluted seas, toxic fish, and worst of all, no television or coffee. And that's just the first day. Sunburned, emaciated, and stinging with sea lice, Troost spends the next two years battling incompetent government officials, alarmingly large critters, erratic electricity, and a paucity of food options. He contends with a cast of bizarre local characters, including \"Half-Dead Fred\" and the self-proclaimed Poet Laureate of Tarawa (a British drunkard who's never written a poem in his life), and eventually settles into the ebb and flow of island life, just before his return to the culture shock of civilization. With the rollicking wit of Bill Bryson, the brilliant travel exposition of Paul Theroux, and a hipster edge that is entirely Troost's own, The Sex Lives of Cannibals is the ultimate vicarious adventure. Readers may never long to set foot on Tarawa, but they'll want to travel with Troost time and time again.\n", "genres": ["Autobiography", "Book Club", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Humor", "Travel", "Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Audiobook", "Memoir", "Biography"]}, "9419": {"bookid": "9419", "title": "Shopaholic Ties the Knot", "author": "Sophie Kinsella", "series": "(Shopaholic #3)", "ratings": "108179", "reviews": "2714", "rating": "3.78", "description": "For once in Becky Bloomwood's life, things are going smoothly.

Elsa Pendleton travels from England to Easter Island with her husband, an anthropologist sent by the Royal Geographical Society to study the colossal moai statues, and her younger sister. What begins as familial duty for Elsa becomes a grand adventure; on Easter Island she discovers her true calling. But, out of contact with the outside world, she is unaware that World War I has been declared and that a German naval squadron, fleeing the British across the South Pacific, is heading toward the island she now considers home.Sixty years later, Dr. Greer Farraday, an American botanist, travels to Easter Island to research the island's ancient pollen, but more important, to put back the pieces of her life after the death of her husband.A series of brilliant revelations brings to life the parallel quests of these two intrepid young women as they delve into the centuries-old mysteries of Easter Island. Slowly unearthing the island's haunting past, they are forced to confront turbulent discoveries about themselves and the people they love, changing their lives forever.Easter Island is a tour de force of storytelling that will establish Jennifer Vanderbes as one of the most gifted writers of her generation.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Anthropology", "Historical Fiction", "Book Club", "Novels", "Historical", "Adult Fiction", "Travel", "Womens"]}, "625233": {"bookid": "625233", "title": "The Good Companions", "author": "J.B.

It was his third novel and it is certainly well-written and very readable. It is, too, an enjoyable romp, all about a stranded theatrical group the Dinky Doos rescued by Miss Trant and coverted into the Good Companions, and involving their adventures with such characters as Jess Oakroyd, the middle-aged joiner from Bruddersford, who breaks free from his miserable domestic existence, Susie Dean and Inigo Jollifant. It is the sort of long, colourful novel which was one of Priestley's hallmarks, and it is clear that Priestley enjoyed himself writing it. He regarded the job as not so much a task, more a kind of holiday.One of the ironies of the success of The Good Companions is that when he discussed his idea for the book with his publishers they told him that such a book would not appeal to the current reading public. However, the germ of the story was embedded deep into his mind and heart, and writing the novel became something of an obsession. He had made up his mind to write a novel that he himself could enjoy even if nobody else did...and, in the event, a great many others also loved it! (The novel arrived at a time when the country was in depression, and someone commented that The Good Companions \"soared out of the gloom like a fairy tale to lift thousands of minds into a world of literary enchantment.\"David Hughes in \"J.B. Priestley:An Informal Study of His Work\", wrote: \"The Good Companions is a simple book, plainly constructed and straightforwardly told. Like so much of Priestley's work, its action begins on a note of rebellion, while its impulse is the search for romance without losing sight of reality; indeed, staring into the very heart of reality for the magic. Jess Oakroyd is pitched into loneliness by the drab quarrrelling of his family. Miss Trant, suddenly relieved in early middle age of a burden that might have lasted her lifetime, turns against the trivial monotony of her genteel days in a Cotswold village. Inigo Jollifant, surrounded in the prep school where he teaches by petty rulings, is refused permission to play the piano by the headmaster's wife, gets drunk and escapes into the night. Three separate rebellions against the frustrations of life put three characters on the road for what is probably the longest picaresque novel in English since Pickwick.\"Priestley started to write The Good Companions in January 1928, and he delivered the manuscript to Heinemann in March 1929.At least two films have been made of The Good Companions, and it has been turned into a play on several occasions.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Classic Literature", "Literature", "British Literature", "20th Century", "Novels", "European Literature", "Classics", "Literary Fiction", "Plays", "Theatre"]}, "5067628": {"bookid": "5067628", "title": "Original Sin", "author": "P.D.

But when her boss, Milo, simultaneously cuts her bartending hours and introduces her to a \"friend\" looking for a private eye, Izzy reluctantly finds herself with a new client. She assures herself that the case -- a suspicious husband who wants his wife tailed -- will be short and sweet, and will involve nothing more than the most boring of PI rituals: surveillance. But with each passing hour, Izzy finds herself with more questions than hard evidence.Meanwhile, Spellmania continues. Izzy's brother, David, the family's most upright member, has adopted an uncharacteristically unkempt appearance and attitude toward work, life, and Izzy. And their wayward youngest sister, Rae, a historic academic underachiever, aces the PSATs and subsequently offends her study partner and object of obsession, Detective Henry Stone, to the point of excommunication. The only unsurprising behavior comes from her parents, whose visits to Milo's bar amount to thinly veiled surveillance and artful attempts (read: blackmail) at getting Izzy to return to the Spellman Inc. fold.As the case of the wayward wife continues to vex her, Izzy's personal life -- and mental health -- seem to be disintegrating. Facing a housing crisis, she can't sleep, she can't remember where she parked her car, and, despite her shrinks' persistence, she can't seem to break through in her appointments. She certainly can't explain why she forgets dates with her lawyer's grandson, or fails to interpret the come-ons issued in an Irish brogue by Milo's new bartender. Nor can she explain exactly how she feels about Detective Henry Stone and his plans to move in with his new Assistant DA girlfriend...Filled with the signature side-splitting Spellman antics, Revenge of the Spellmans is an ingenious, hilarious, and disarmingly tender installment in the Spellman series.\n", "genres": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Comedy", "Chick Lit", "Detective", "Humor", "Adult", "Contemporary", "Adult Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Thriller"]}, "82783": {"bookid": "82783", "title": "Feeling Sorry for Celia", "author": "Jaclyn Moriarty", "series": "(Ashbury/Brookfield #1)", "ratings": "10492", "reviews": "682", "rating": "3.81", "description": "A funny, touching, revealing story written entirely in the form of letters, messages, postcards - and bizarre missives.

As a teenager, he could have been an amateur wrestling Olympic contender, but instead he turned to the family business, climbing into the ring for his dad\u2019s western circuit, Stampede Wrestling. From his early twenties until he retired at 43, Hart kept an audio diary, recording stories of the wrestling life, the relentless travel, the practical jokes, the sex and drugs, and the real rivalries (as opposed to the staged ones). The result is an intimate, no-holds-barred account that will keep readers, not just wrestling fans, riveted.Hart achieved superstardom in pink tights, and won multiple wrestling belts in multiple territories, for both the WWF (now the WWE) and WCW. But he also paid the price in betrayals (most famously by Vince McMahon, a man he had served loyally); in tragic deaths, including the loss of his brother Owen, who died when a stunt went terribly wrong; and in his own massive stroke, most likely resulting from a concussion he received in the ring, and from which, with the spirit of a true champion, he has battled back.Widely considered by his peers as one of the business\u2019s best technicians and workers, Hart describes pro wrestling as part dancing, part acting, and part dangerous physical pursuit. He is proud that in all his years in the ring he never seriously hurt a single wrestler, yet did his utmost to deliver to his fans an experience as credible as it was exciting. He also records the incredible toll the business takes on its workhorses: he estimates that twenty or more of the wrestlers he was regularly matched with have died young, weakened by their own coping mechanisms, namely drugs, alcohol, and steroids. That toll included his own brother-in-law, Davey Boy Smith. No one has ever written about wrestling like Bret Hart. No one has ever lived a life like Bret Hart\u2019s.For as long as I can remember, my world was filled with liars and bullshitters, losers and pretenders, but I also saw the good side of pro wrestling. To me there is something bordering on beautiful about a brotherhood of big tough men who pretended to hurt one another for a living instead of actually doing it.

While Jane is trying to master undead dating, she is also donning the ugliest bridesmaid's dress in history at her best friend Zeb's Titanic-themed wedding. Between a freaked-out groom-to-be, his hostile werewolf in-laws, and Zeb's mother, hell-bent on seeing Jane walk the aisle with Zeb, Jane's got the feeling she's just rearranging the proverbial deck chairs.Meanwhile, Half Moon Hollow's own Black Widow, Jane's Grandma Ruthie, has met her match in her latest fiance. He smells like bad cheese and has a suspicious history of dead spouses. But Jane's biting her tongue. After all, would a nice girl really think she has a future with a vampire?Listening Length: 10 hours and 13 minutes\n", "genres": ["Urban Fantasy", "Fiction", "Vampires", "Chick Lit", "Fantasy", "Humor", "Romance", "Paranormal", "Audiobook", "Womens Fiction", "Paranormal Romance"]}, "1590979": {"bookid": "1590979", "title": "Curse of the Spellmans", "author": "Lisa Lutz", "series": "(The Spellmans #2)", "ratings": "18385", "reviews": "1494", "rating": "4.04", "description": "THEY'RE BAAAAACK.

Now the Spellmans, a highly functioning yet supremely dysfunctional family of private investigators, return in a sidesplittingly funny story of suspicion, surveillance, and surprise.  When Izzy Spellman, PI, is arrested for the fourth time in three months, she writes it off as a job hazard. She's been (obsessively) keeping surveillance on a suspicious next door neighbor (suspect's name: John Brown), convinced he's up to no good -- even if her parents (the management at Spellman Investigations) are not.  When the (displeased) management refuses to bail Izzy out, it is Morty, Izzy's octogenarian lawyer, who comes to her rescue. But before he can build a defense, he has to know the facts. Over weak coffee and diner sandwiches, Izzy unveils the whole truth and nothing but the truth -- as only she, a thirty-year-old licensed professional, can.  When not compiling Suspicious Behavior Reports on all her family members, staking out her neighbor, or trying to keep her sister, Rae, from stalking her \"best friend,\" Inspector Henry Stone, Izzy has been busy attempting to apprehend the copycat vandal whose attacks on Mrs. Chandler's holiday lawn tableaux perfectly and eerily match a series of crimes from 1991\u00c2\u00ad-92, when Izzy and her best friend, Petra, happened to be at their most rebellious and delinquent. As Curse of the Spellmans unfolds, it's clear that Morty may be on retainer, but Izzy is still very much on the case...er, cases -- her own and that of every other Spellman family member.  (Re)meet the Spellmans, a family in which eavesdropping is a mandatory skill, locks are meant to be picked, past missteps are never forgotten, and blackmail is the preferred form of negotiation -- all in the name of unconditional love.\n", "genres": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Comedy", "Chick Lit", "Detective", "Humor", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Audiobook", "Womens Fiction", "Thriller"]}, "29799": {"bookid": "29799", "title": "The Way of a Pilgrim and the Pilgrim Continues His Way", "author": "Anonymous", "series": "", "ratings": "4945", "reviews": "296", "rating": "4.11", "description": "This enduring work of Russian spirituality has charmed countless people with its tale of a nineteenth-century peasant's quest for the secret of prayer.

As Noori indicates, his attempt to preserve the overabundance of dashes gives the reader a more immediate sense of the narrator's agitation...The first sentence flows on in Noori's translation, piling sensation upon sensation never allowing us to pause and catch our breath or separate out the images from the sensations. In his discussion of the relationship between his translation and Costello's, Noori also draws on translation theory and sees Costello's focus on the fluidity of the text in English as a \"domestication\" of Hedayat's original. Noori's new English translation and his preface are a welcome addition and will no doubt draw the attention of scholars interested in Hedayat's works. The close textual and comparative analysis of the type Noori offers marks a new and long-overdue critical approach to the translation of the most celebrated work of modern Persian prose.\" -Professor Nasrin Rahimieh in Middle Eastern Literatures\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Short Stories", "Literature", "Novella", "20th Century", "Iran", "Horror", "Philosophy", "Novels", "Classics", "Cultural"]}, "30125": {"bookid": "30125", "title": "The Missing Piece Meets the Big O", "author": "Shel Silverstein", "series": "(The Missing Piece #2)", "ratings": "12867", "reviews": "646", "rating": "4.36", "description": "The missing piece sat alone waiting for someone to come along and take it somewhere....\nThe different ones it encounters - and what it discovers in its helplessness - are portrayed with simplicity and compassion in the words and drawings of Shel Silve", "genres": ["Picture Books", "Poetry", "Fiction", "Childrens", "Sequential Art", "Philosophy", "Humor", "Classics", "Young Adult", "Inspirational", "Comics"]}, "17455585": {"bookid": "17455585", "title": "White Hot Kiss", "author": "Jennifer L.

Instead, millennials have been raised to hold hedonism above all. Whatever feels good goes. Freedoms and rights are things for legislators and judges to conjure out of thin air, not precious traditions forged in the crucible of history. Most millennials reject the nuclear family, and the religious values, that our culture was built on because they resemble some sort of \u201cunenlightened\u201d old world of responsibility and duty that millennials want no part in.  In short, squaring the truth about the West with the twisted values they\u2019ve been brought up to swallow without complaint is not something that will be comfortable for many millennials. But I think that if not now, eventually most of them will take the plunge. Because deep down I think we know that what we\u2019ve done is not empowering. Abandoning all guidance of our past and embracing hedonism and subjectivity was not some genius idea. Dismissing the guidance built for us over thousands and thousands of years in the form of gender roles, traditional lifestyles, hard work, objectivity, and cultural supremacy was, in fact, painfully stupid.  Because really, what have we got to show for it? Nothing but infinite license to put who and what we want in our bodies, while our freedoms to speak, to think, to dream, and to build get more limited every day. We\u2019ve decided to fall backwards off the shoulders of giants, and that fall probably feels good, until you realize there\u2019s going to be a \u201csplat\u201d at the end.  So with the ground of reality rushing up at them, more and more young people are clawing for anything to stop their feelings of personal, ethical, political, intellectual and artistic failure. And the rotted timber of progressivism is increasingly failing to break their fall. So eventually, they turn elsewhere.  And so, a steadily increasing number of millennials are finally beginning to wake up to the choice we face as a civilization, and to the value they\u2019ve so long overlooked in traditional standards of morality and beauty. They are wondering: is modern culture really so great if it means we substitute Meghan Trainor for Mozart, Emma Sulkowicz for Da Vinci, or Bell Hooks for Plato? Is it really such a step forward that our civilization, which once shed both blood and ink debating Martin Luther\u2019s 95 Theses, is now reduced to considering theses like VICE Magazine\u2019s \u201cDear Straight Guys: It\u2019s Time to Start Putting Things In Your Butt?\u201d Is this all there is, or can we do better?  No, it isn\u2019t, and yes, we can and must do better. Sure, it\u2019ll be hard for us to dig ourselves out of the pit that the left-wing indoctrination and media machines has dug for everyone our age. But it\u2019s work worth doing. Because right now, the world is on fire. And while my generation didn\u2019t start the fire, with apologies to Billy Joel, I believe we have a chance to contain it, or even put it out.  But first we have to expose the frauds, liars, idiots, and above all, barbarians who threw gas on it.

Bernard Cornwell's epic novel Stonehenge catapults us into a powerful and vibrant world of ritual and sacrifice at once timeless and wholly original-a tale of patricide, betrayal, and murder; of bloody brotherly rivalry: and of the never-ending quest for power, wealth, and spiritual fulfillment.Three brothers-deadly rivals-are uneasily united in their quest to create a temple to their gods. There is Lengar, the eldest, a ruthless warrior intent on replacing his father as chief of the tribe of Ratharryn; Camaban, his bastard brother, a sorcerer whose religious fervor inspires the plan for Stonehenge; and Saban, the youngest, through whose expertise the temple will finally be completed. Divided by blood but united-precariously-by a shared vision, the brothers begin erecting their mighty ring of granite, aligning towering stones to the movement of the heavenly bodies, and raising arches to appease and unite their gods. Caught between the zealousness of his ambitious brothers, Saban becomes the true leader of his people, a peacemaker who will live to see the temple built in the name of salvation and regeneration.Bernard Cornwell, long admired for his rousing narrative and meticulous historical imaginings, has here delivered his masterpiece, the most compelling and powerful human drama of its kind since Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and Edward Rutherford's Sarum. His re-creation of civilization as it might have been in 2000 B.C. at once amplifies the mystery of his subject and makes the world of Stonehenge come alive as never before.\n", "genres": ["Fiction", "Prehistory", "British Literature", "Historical Fiction", "Prehistoric", "Adventure", "European Literature", "Fantasy", "Novels", "Historical", "History", "Historical Fantasy"]}, "7010624": {"bookid": "7010624", "title": "Doubting Jesus' Resurrection: What Happened in the Black Box?", "author": "Kris D.

Judy struggles with the reaction of her children when they discover their family's twenty-year secret Left in His Closet.

Their success and failures are profiled on and off the stage. Spanning nearly a decade their respective roles in life confront tremendous family pressures, the pitfalls of fame, and the pivotal importance of friendships lost and those found. The dancers odd and daringly different pairing begins in the early eighties. Their relationship is initially formed through a mutual understanding of emotional loneliness and disparity. The core of their fragile bond is tested over time within a fleet of personal challenges set on dividing the pair. As the unwanted son of a fleeing father and a resentful mother of a stolen career in dance, eighteen-year old Hart Nader has left his foolish past of sleeping about with strangers behind him. His young years as a dancer in training have enrolled him in one of the finest dance schools in London where he seeks to become the success his mother once dreamed of becoming. During his dance studies he is met with a company of jealous rivals eager to destroy his dreams. His classmates animosity is second in nature to a dynasty of dysfunctional aristocrats that seek to ruin his chance for true love with one of their own. Twenty-eight year old Sebastian Seymour is Europe\u2019s leading prince of ballet. Heir to one of the richest and most powerful families in England, Sebastian dances with demons unseen by the people that most admire his artistic talent. His flawless footwork and phenomenal stage presence made him a global star. His well-guarded private life conceals secrets brutally tormenting and sinisterly scarring. All of which threaten to end his dancing days at the height of his brilliant career. The two dancers struggle to make a life together. They defy family members; dismiss friends while dancing hand and hand through a deeply affecting and frightfully destructive intimate partnership. A relationship so immensely flawed that neither of the two may survive it.

Les' parents were poor but his father was a hard worker and provided well for the 11 children, who had to sleep 4 to 5 in a bed. It tells of a family bound together with love until one day they are split apart due to the continual struggle by their father to stay in gainful employment. These early years deeply contrast the next twenty or so years of his life. He becomes a member of one of the most ruthless gangs of 1960's London, and as a consequence, of his dealings he spends time in various prisons and remand centres where he receives vicious beatings from numerous prison officers. Soon after his release from Norwich Prison, whilst totally disillusioned by all he has experienced, he drops out of society to become a tramp. The next five years are spent living on the streets, each day a struggle to survive. At times, he trudges the streets, having not eaten for a week, existing in the soaking wet and biting cold. He becomes an alcoholic-this is the only way to block out the cold on the long winter nights. This part of the story shows the dignity and humanity of street-people, who were once someone's baby, warm and loved. Now they are homeless, treated with contempt and even rejected by parts of the Church. After five years on the streets, his health failing, he's finally taken in by a family whose love and care help him become a reformed character, eventually finding his faith in God and becoming a Church Minister.

Author Alma Hudson writes with extraordinary vision and clarity, bringing racial issues to the forefront with delicate balance and thoughtful compassion. Its the late 1970s in California; a time of racial turbulence, but change is in the air and Diane Jones, an African-American 18-year old honors student will come face to face with those changes. Diane takes a job as a nanny to a prestigious white family, Jerry and Ann Shaw, before entering college. She quickly becomes a respected friend and member of their blended family, paying special attention to their eight-year old son, Chad, Anns son from a previous marriage. Their eldest son, David returns home for the summer and an immediate attraction sparks between Diane and David. They began a secretive love affair. Can Dianes proud, traditional family accept a white man as Dianes love interest and will the Shaws value her as their sons potential partner? As their love affair blossoms, they decide to make their relationship public. This story of an interracial love during the turbulent 70s deftly explores the ugly racism that propelled our nations conscious to change toward a more diversified culture. Written with sophisticated realism, Hudsons novel stands out as a literary piece of significance during our present-day political climate.\n", "genres": ["Fiction"]}, "8084689": {"bookid": "8084689", "title": "Temporary Power Outages", "author": "Sandra  Lott", "series": "", "ratings": "10", "reviews": "4", "rating": "4.20", "description": "When we think of the word \"temporary,\" we think of momentary, just for a season, not lasting forever, or just for a little while.

So many people feel that being a Christian means your troubles are over. Some people even feel that they are unworthy of God's love and His blessings. Meanwhile, there are others who feel that since they are saved, they have everything in the bag. The author of this book struggled with her identity early in childhood and continued to struggle throughout part of her adult life. Only God knew how she felt about life and how disappointing it was at times. The author shares her many encounters with God throughout her life and how He kept her from Satan's snares.

The story, which became the vehicle to accomplish this, came to me in Sydney, Nebraska at a Dairy Queen. There, inside the newly remodeled restaurant, was a picture of a long ago defunct band who called themselves... The Zonks.  The boys who comprised the band were sitting on a Volkswagen Beetle with their instruments in front of a Dairy Queen from either the early 70's or late 60's, judging from the incidental evidence. The caption in the photograph indicated that they had been hired to travel around the country and give impromptu concerts, obviously to draw crowds and sell ice cream cones. The picture was just a decorative memento, but I was mesmerized, and stared at it for an inordinate amount of time.  Later, while traveling down the interstate, I began to wonder about the guys who made up the band. I wondered if they missed those bygone days. I wondered where they were and what they were doing now. And then, I imagined what might happen if they had a reunion, and a little magic came along...  This mythical reunion is where the story starts. It is there that the characters in my book discover that they still have a burning desire to create and share music. The fictionalized Zonks still want the dream 40 years after they broke up, and I don't think they are very different from any boy who ever picked up a guitar and tried to play three chords and carry a tune. There are millions and millions of wannabe rock stars driving trucks, delivering mail, assembling widgets, and doing any manner of mundane job that you might care to imagine.  What would I give to be able to play guitar like Jimmy Page? Name your body part. And, I know, I am not unusual. I move people for a living, and I know it's unusual for a man to not have a college guitar buried deep in his closet- literally, and figuratively.  What really happened to the boys on the Volkswagen? If this book becomes popular maybe we will all find out. I know I am curious. It would be fun to see if my storyline, or character development, in any way mirrors the actual story of their lives. What if this book motivates them to have a real reunion? What if they really did record some songs 40 years ago? I for one would love to hear an old Zonk 45. Anyone out there gotta turntable? Anyone out there still know what a 45 is? A show of hands please? You there! Yeah you! Way in the back! Remember when vinyl ruled? Remember when digital data was only in science fiction novels?

Its ancient guardians still thrive in its walls forever protecting its dark secrets, holding captive an enemy that threatens their very existence. Foretold is a story of an ancient warrior that is to return to the castle to free the captive Vampire Prince. Simon Roberts was a petty thief who fled England to escape Scotland Yard after a series of unsuccessful jewelry store heists. He was recruited to do a job in Germany where he was to simply drive the get away car while providing a look out. He thought this was going to be an easy job and a way to break into the German crime scene. But things go terribly wrong and he ended up being the only survivor of the botched heist. Simon is quickly sentenced to a prison called Rhinehoth. This is where Germany sent the worst of the worst, surely not a place for a petty thief such as himself. Rhinehoth is a great German castle that was converted in the late 1930's to a Stalag for war criminals of World War II. The converted prison's modern day inhabitants are relentlessly tortured, starved and sleep deprived. This contributes to the prisoners' delusional visions that help hide the truth and keeps Rhinehoth's secrets. Their captors are the army of Werewolves who have survived the centuries off the very flesh and blood of Germany's worst forgotten criminals. Simon, imprisoned becomes plagued with visions from his subconscious ancient past with confusion of his modern day consciousness.

They settle into a large cavern which is the first of many strange \u2018coincidences\u2019 that enable them to survive many years in the cavern safe from outside contamination. Knowing that ignorance and intolerance led to the virtual demise of humanity, the group decide to teach the future generation differently. Their plan: to raise their children in an environment of peace and love, devoid of the hate and aggression that plagued humans for so long.They emerge from the cavern many generations later with Tsulib, a tribe elder as their guide who continues the group\u2019s goal of changing the way future generations think by keeping the destructive history of humans secret from the younger tribe members. This decision will be challenged with a very cruel lesson that will put the whole tribe in jeopardy.

Heart\u2019s Blood is a riveting family saga set on the border of southern Arizona. The story follows the life of the central character, Tyler McNeil, from his impulsive (and fateful) decision to leave his itinerant existence, through unexpected parenthood, loss, love, and finally peace in his old age. A cast of colorful characters wander in and out of the tale, sometimes taking center stage, sometimes weaving themselves into the tapestry of the whole. We meet Mana, an illiterate and abused border crosser who bears a child and then vanishes; Lita, her infant daughter whom Ty adopts and raises; the complex and evil Blanco, leader of a powerful drug cartel; the frightening Marcela Beltran, Blanco\u2019s wife, who only eats white food and covets Lita\u2019s daughter; Claire, the love of Ty\u2019s life whose stumbling heart threatens to take her from him; and, CJ, Ty\u2019s natural son who rejects him when he learns of his parenthood. These and many others serve up a hearty mixture of love, hate, murder, compassion, and humor. On one important level, Heart\u2019s Blood is a novel of place, filled with lyrical and cinematic descriptions of the vistas of southern Arizona, the changing seasons, and the rich mix of rural life at the end of the 20th century. On another level it brims with those themes that scream at us daily from the media -- the evils of the drug trade, illegal immigration, human smuggling, and the plight of those caught up in the drama of life on both sides of the border. But at the most fundamental level its themes transcend place and time, for it is a tale of secrets kept and revealed, blood ties versus emotional ties, blood spilled and blood passed on from generation to generation, family to family.\n", "genres": []}, "176336": {"bookid": "176336", "title": "Indigo", "author": "Graham Joyce", "series": "", "ratings": "599", "reviews": "47", "rating": "3.32", "description": "Indigo is a color the human eye can never truly see, a slice of the spectrum imbued with the promise of invisibility.

Brotherton's writing far exceeds that of standard vampire fare...\" -Kirkus ReviewsIn the small town of Keating, Iowa, the surname Daniels is synonymous with insanity. Recently dumped by his girlfriend and fired from his job, Merton Daniels has been reduced to crashing on a friend's couch and visiting a blood center to exchange his plasma for cash. Awakened from an unintentional drunken stupor by a voice in his head calling his name, Merton finds a mysterious card tucked under his arm. A subsequent meeting with a beleaguered bureaucrat sets Merton, along with his chattering roommate, Coaler, on an unsupervised apprenticeship in the finer points of reclaiming the dead: slaying vampires.While Merton combats delusions and an inner voice that hounds him with a relentlessness that exceeds even that of his undead adversaries, the novel tracks a thought-provoking mythology of the undead in Judas Iscariot, a shape-shifting and blood-thirsty creature who was reborn when the boundary between life and death was still convulsing.Resonant with existential echoes of Sartre and Salinger, and a singular sense of humor that recalls Vonnegut and Palahniuk, Reclaiming the Dead is an infectious and inventive tale that stands the vampire fantasy genre on its ear with a literate and sophisticated story of modern life and redemption.\"Anyone who fights with monsters should take care that he does not in the process become a monster.

The same morning--the first of a new Muslim century--hundreds of gunmen stunned the world by seizing Islam's holiest shrine, the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Armed with rifles that they had smuggled inside coffins, these men came from more than a dozen countries, launching the first operation of global jihad in modern times. Led by a Saudi preacher named Juhayman al Uteybi, they believed that the Saudi royal family had become a craven servant of American infidels, and sought a return to the glory of uncompromising Islam. With nearly 100,000 worshippers trapped inside the holy compound, Mecca's bloody siege lasted two weeks, inflaming Muslim rage against the United States and causing hundreds of deaths. Despite U.S. assistance, the Saudi royal family proved haplessly incapable of dislodging the occupier, whose ranks included American converts to Islam. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini blamed the Great Satan--the United States --for defiling the shrine, prompting mobs to storm and torch American embassies in Pakistan and Libya. The desperate Saudis finally enlisted the help of French commandos led by tough-as-nails Captain Paul Barril, who prepared the final assault and supplied poison gas that knocked out the insurgents. Though most captured gunmen were quickly beheaded, the Saudi royal family responded to this unprecedented challenge by compromising with the rebels' supporters among the kingdom's most senior clerics, helping them nurture and export Juhayman's violent brand of Islam around the world. This dramatic and immensely consequential story was barely covered in the press in the pre-CNN, pre-Al Jazeera days, as Saudi Arabia imposed an information blackout and kept foreign correspondents away. Yaroslav Trofimov now penetrates this veil of silence, interviewing for the first time scores of direct participants in the siege, including former terrorists, and drawing on hundreds of documents that had been declassified on his request. Written with the pacing, detail, and suspense of a real-life thriller, \"The Siege of Mecca\" reveals how Saudi reaction to the uprising in Mecca set free the forces that produced the attacks of 9/11, and the harrowing circumstances that surround us today.\n", "genres": ["Religion", "Military Fiction", "Politics", "Islam", "War", "Literature", "Terrorism", "20th Century", "Writing", "Journalism", "History", "Nonfiction"]}, "10933913": {"bookid": "10933913", "title": "Crack Hardy: From Gallipoli to Flanders to the Somme, the True Story of Three Australian Brothers at War", "author": "Stephen Dando-Collins", "series": "", "ratings": "40", "reviews": "5", "rating": "4.60", "description": "This is the true story of three Australian soldiers, the Searle brothers.

These candid discussions with leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, with muftis, sheikhs, and ayatollahs, with Osama bin Laden\u2019s brothers, reveal these men to be real people with emotions, fears, and hopes of their own. Along the way, Dekker and Medearis discover surprising answers and even more surprising questions that they could not have anticipated\u2014questions that lead straight to the heart of Middle Eastern conflict.Through powerful narrative Tea With Hezbollah will draw the West into a completely fresh understanding of those we call our enemies and the teaching that dares us to love them. A must read for all who see the looming threat rising in the Middle East.\n", "genres": ["Religion", "Politics", "Faith", "Christian Non Fiction", "Historical", "Travel", "History", "Audiobook", "Christian", "Nonfiction"]}, "12360292": {"bookid": "12360292", "title": "Some Time Never: A Fable for Supermen", "author": "Roald Dahl", "series": "", "ratings": "137", "reviews": "18", "rating": "3.18", "description": "Some Time Never is a blend of realism and outrageous fantasy.

She quickly attracted a loyal following that was captivated by the upbeat mother happily raising her young children, madly in love with her husband, Christian (Mr. Nielson to her readers), and filled with gratitude for her blessed life.However, everything changed in an instant on a sunny day in August 2008, when Stephanie and Christian were in a horrific plane crash. Christian was burned over 40 percent of his body, and Stephanie was on the brink of death, with burns over 80 percent of her body. She would remain in a coma for four months.In the aftermath of this harrowing tragedy, Stephanie maintained a stunning sense of humor, optimism, and resilience. She has since shared this strength of spirit with others through her blog, in magazine features, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Now, in this moving memoir, Stephanie tells the full, extraordinary story of her unlikely recovery and the incredible love behind it\u2014from a riveting account of the crash to all that followed in its wake. With vivid detail, Stephanie recounts her emotional and physical journey, from her first painful days after awakening from the coma to the first time she saw her face in the mirror, the first kiss she shared with Christian after the accident, and the first time she talked to her children after their long separation. She also reflects back on life before the accident, to her happy childhood as one of nine siblings, her close-knit community and strong Mormon faith, and her fairy-tale love story, all of which became her foundation of strength as she rebuilt her life.What emerges from the wreckage of a tragic accident is a unique perspective on joy, beauty, and overcoming adversity that is as gripping as it is inspirational.

He crept through the house and down the stairs. He entered my ground floor bedroom and hid in the shadows. When I came into my bedroom from the bathroom, he grabbed me and locked me in a bear-hug. I felt something being wound tightly around my neck and something was being stuffed into my mouth. I couldn't breathe. I never saw the face of the man who assaulted and raped me that night. I never believed he would be caught. I spent 20 years wondering who he was, how many other women he had raped and when he would strike again. If not for the dogged determination of Chief Investigator David Cordle, of Anne Arundel County, in Annapolis, Md, my case would never have been solved. With the help of a grant from the government to re-test cold case evidence and the advances of forensic science, a suspect was found and arrested in November of 2009. Beginning in 2010, after my case went to trial, Dave Cordle and I began sharing this story in the book we wrote- One Voice Raised, A Triumph Over Rape. We have been invited to speak at many conferences, schools, police departments and awareness organizations in the United States and Canada. My message is one of hope; hope for survivors and their families to believe in their strength and the goodness of others. There is no doubt that being raped changed my life. Having my case solved and finally seeing the face of my attacker in the courtroom was extremely empowering for me. Hearing the \"Guilty\" verdicts on January 13, 2010 helped me to realize I am much stronger than I give myself credit for. In our presentations, I speak about my experience as a rape victim and the years of rebuilding my life and how I found a way to make the passage from thinking of myself as a victim of rape to calling myself a survivor.

Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the land, twentieth-century classical music still sends ripples of unease through audiences. At the same time, its influence can be felt everywhere. Atonal chords crop up in jazz. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalism has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward.The Rest Is Noise shows why twentieth-century composers felt compelled to create a famously bewildering variety of sounds, from the purest beauty to the purest noise. It tells of a remarkable array of maverick personalities who resisted the cult of the classical past, struggled against the indifference of a wide public, and defied the will of dictators. Whether they have charmed audiences with sweet sounds or battered them with dissonance, composers have always been exuberantly of the present, defying the stereotype of classical music as a dying art. The narrative goes from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties, from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia to downtown New York in the sixties and seventies. We follow the rise of mass culture and mass politics, of dramatic new technologies, of hot and cold wars, of experiments, revolutions, riots, and friendships forged and broken. The end result is not so much a history of twentieth-century music as a history of the twentieth century through its music.\n", "genres": ["Criticism", "Literature", "Art", "Music", "Reference", "History", "Cultural", "Unfinished", "Classical Music", "Nonfiction", "21st Century"]}, "6101055": {"bookid": "6101055", "title": "When I Married My Mother: A Daughter\u2019s Search for What Really Matters\u2014and How She Found It Caring for Mama Jo", "author": "Jo Maeder", "series": "", "ratings": "2697", "reviews": "307", "rating": "4.00", "description": "Jo Maeder was an ambitious DJ in New York City when she did the unthinkable: she moved to the Bible Belt to look after her frail, estranged mother, who had long been a source of intense frustration.

My name is Dave, and this is my very first collection of essays. As you can probably imagine, it pretty much has everything. In fact, if you like stories about stolen meat, animal attacks, young love, death, naked people, clergymen, rock 'n' roll, irritable Canadians, and prison, you have just hit a street called Easy because my book talks about all that stuff and a bunch of other stuff, too.Getting back to that prison thing for a second\u2014I can think of almost no better place to read my book than from within the confines of a correctional facility. For starters, you will definitely have the time. Also, cozying up with a good book in front of your fellow inmates is a great way to show them a softer side that for some reason no one ever wants to hear about in the yard.Fear not, though, non-convicts, my book makes for a solid read outside of prison, too. At the beach, on the subway, while whitewater rafting, during couples counseling, under local anesthesia\u2014I have personally seen to it that my book is totally readable in all these scenarios, as well as in most other scenarios out there today. It will make you laugh, cry, and maybe even think so much that you will forget all your problems while simultaneously creating a few new ones. In limited instances it has been known to cause severe dehydration and the occasional groin pull, but honestly I don't know what that's about. That said, it's probably not a bad idea to keep a glass of water handy and really stretch things out before strapping yourself in for a literary thrill ride you will want to experience again and again until you are either dead or your eyesight fails completely, whichever comes first. In fact, if I end up being wrong about any of this stuff, you can kick me right in the privates. Also, I will send you a nice ham (serves twenty).

Then, in a broad sweep, the book moves forward to consider not the battles and treaties of kings and prime ministers, emperors and generals, but the most important ideas we have evolved, by which we live and which separate us from other animals. Watson explores the first languages and the first words, the birth of the gods, the origins of art, the profound intellectual consequences of money. He describes the invention of writing, early ideas about law, why sacrifice and the soul have proved so enduring in religion. He explains how ideas about time evolved, how numbers were conceived, how science, medicine, sociology, economics, and capitalism came into being. He shows how the discovery of the New World changed forever the way that we think, and why Chinese creativity faded after the Middle Ages.In the course of this commanding narrative, Watson reveals the linkages down the ages in the ideas of many apparently disparate philosophers, astronomers, religious leaders, biologists, inventors, poets, jurists, and scores of others.

The story follows the early career of Everette DeGolyer, whose oil discoveries propelled Mexico into one of the largest oil producing nations at the time when the world's industries and navies became dependent on foreign crude, foreshadowing World War I and today's reliance on Mideast oil.

While many see a change in diet as their solution, and guidance is readily available from a host of books and experts, why is it so often said that diets don't work? In his book, Diet Success Strategies, author Alan Aronoff explains that diets often don't work because people don't stay on them long enough to see results, and more importantly, create new eating habits. This in-depth yet straightforward book reveals that people often fail to sustain a change in diet because their efforts are based solely on self-discipline.

Entrusted with the iconic Ground Zero flag, the Roosevelt battlegroup took to the seas searching out those responsible, and to bring justice to a nation in mourning. On 1145 September 2001, the U.S.S. Leyte Gulf deployed within hours of the attack on the W.T.C. with orders to shoot down and destroy any \"birds not squawking\" over New York City. We were entrusted with the Ground Zero flag raised by the NYFD. We flew that flag with pride and determination from our mast on our important mission. After two days we were then redirected to the gulf and given orders to destroy the Taliban with the Tomahawk missiles onboard. During transit, we were told by our Captain that the Taliban would be waiting for us in the narrow Suez canal. So narrow in fact, only a single ship can go through at any one time. If the first and last ship were to be hit by surface to air missiles, there would be no way out. The aircraft carrier U.S.S Roosevelt, would be trapped in the middle and defenseless. There they were, waiting for us on horseback atop the sandy Suez dunes...following us. Just a bunch of scared kids manning the ships 50 cal guns, wondering what was to happen next. One late night in the gulf, Bush declared war. It was our task to launch the first Tomahawk missiles and kick off the war on terror. We were cut off from the outside world. Email and any other means of communication had been banned for security reasons. Television reports of Anthrax gripping the country with fear and WW3 rumors scuttling through the ships decks. A six man boarding party manned up to routinely search an unresponding suspect Iraqi tanker...what was found would change our lives forever.This is our sea story.\n", "genres": ["Military Fiction", "War", "History", "Nonfiction", "Biography"]}, "13237848": {"bookid": "13237848", "title": "Genesis Unbound: A Provocative New Look at the Creation Account", "author": "John H.
